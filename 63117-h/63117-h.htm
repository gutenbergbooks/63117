<p class="noindent"><span class="largecap">T</span>he extraordinarily rapid progress which the recent
invention of lighting with coal gas has made in this
country, is perhaps without a parallel in the history of
the useful arts.</p>

<p>It was an invention not exempted from the misfortune
common to all innovations on established practises, of
encountering opposition, but it had the fortune common
to few, of obtaining an almost instantaneous triumph.</p>

<p>A single exhibition of the gas lights in actual use
was sufficient to determine the public judgment in favour
of the new mode of illumination; to see was in this case,
indeed to believe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Pageii">[ii]</span></p>

<p>The legislature responsive to the popular voice, and
fortified in its responsibility, by the results of special
enquiries which were ordered to be made into the merits
of the invention, and in which I had the good fortune
to be professionally engaged, gave the most liberal and
decided encouragement to its adoption.</p>

<p>Capital, often wanting even in this opulent country for
undertakings of magnitude, came to the promotion of
the new art of procuring and distributing light in overflowing
abundance; and already ere many years are
elapsed, such has been the rapidity with which the gas
light illumination has advanced, that there is not a city
and scarcely a town of any note in Great Britain, in
which the art of lighting by means of gas, has not been
carried into effect, or in which active measures are not in
progress, to participate in the benefit of this important
discovery.</p>

<p>When the art was yet in its infancy, I published a
Treatise, containing a description of the apparatus and
machinery best calculated for illuminating streets, houses,
and public buildings, by means of coal gas, with remarks
on the utility, safety, and general nature of this new
branch of domestic economy, as far as then understood,
and practised in the metropolis.</p>

<p>The universal avidity for information on the subject,
more perhaps than any particular merit in the work<span class="pagenum" id="Pageiii">[iii]</span>
itself, produced a demand in this country for four large
impressions of this work, in the course of a few years,
and I have also had the satisfaction of finding that the
Treatise has been translated into the French, German,
and Italian languages.</p>

<p>Since this work was written, however, the art of manufacturing
and applying coal gas, has undergone so
many material improvements, all combining to bring it
to a degree of simplicity, precision, and economy, far
surpassing every thing which the original mode of
practice exhibited, that I have felt I should be guilty of
an injustice to the constant demand which still exists for
my former Treatise, had I not made it my duty to publish
the work I now present to the reader; superseding
altogether the former publication, but superseding it
from circumstances of necessity, and with a view to good,
which I trust will be found not illusory.</p>

<p>The present treatise, as its title expresses, is intended
to exhibit the superior process of manufacturing coal gas
now employed in the metropolis and the provincial towns
of Great Britain, and to lay before the reader the elevations,
sections, and plans of the improved Gas Light
machinery, which has stood the test of practice, and is
now in action at the most celebrated Gas Light Establishments.</p>

<p>In the <a href="#PartI">first</a> and <a href="#PartII">second part</a>
of the Treatise, I have, as<span class="pagenum" id="Pageiv">[iv]</span>
introductory to the rest, given a sketch of the chemical
theory and production of Gas Light. I have pointed out
the leading objects of public and private utility, to which
the art of lighting with gas has been, or remains to be
applied: and added such other facts and observations
as may serve to remove all doubt in the minds of the
reader as to the important benefit which this country in
particular, and the world at large, have gained by this
discovery.</p>

<p>In the <a href="#PartIII">third part</a> I have stated the maximum quantities
of gas obtainable in the large way, from different kinds of
coal.</p>

<p>In the <a href="#PartIV">fourth part</a>, I have given a description of all
the various forms and dimensions which the distillatory
vessels or retorts have successively assumed, as well as
of the improvements that have been made in the mode of
setting the retorts, with a view to saving them from undue
deterioration, and preventing any improvident waste of
fuel. I have here given a particular account of the distillatory
apparatus now used at the most celebrated gas
works in the metropolis.</p>

<p>The <a href="#PartV">fifth</a> and <a href="#PartVI">sixth parts</a>, lead the reader considerably
further into a knowledge of the economy and practice
of this art. They contain an account of a great variety of
experiments which have been pursued on a large scale,
in order to ascertain the most profitable mode of employing<span class="pagenum" id="Pagev">[v]</span>
the retorts, the differences of opinion which have existed
among practical men with respect to the degree of temperature
fittest to be applied, and the number of hours
at a time during which the retorts may most advantageously
be kept in action, with the particular results
which the experiments instituted into these points have
afforded; and such other data, as will enable the reader
to adopt that mode of operation, which under every
circumstance of locality will be found most advantageous.</p>

<p>The changes which have taken place with respect to
the retorts, have been before detailed in <a href="#PartIV">part fourth</a>;
but in order to give the manufacturer a nearer insight
into the superior advantages attending retorts of the construction
lately brought into use, I have given in <a href="#PartVII">part
seventh</a>, a detailed description of the horizontal rotary retorts,
the application of which has led to a more economical,
expeditious, and easy method of manufacturing coal gas
than heretofore practised. I have distinctly pointed
out the advantages which these retorts present, the particular
results they afford, and the method of applying
them.</p>

<p>The purification of coal gas forms the subject of <a href="#PartVIII">part
eighth</a>. I have compared here, the apparatus for purifying
coal gas, as it was originally constructed, with
the improved machinery lately adopted, showing the<span class="pagenum" id="Pagevi">[vi]</span>
inefficacy and defects of the former, and the decided superiority
which belongs to the latter.</p>

<p>The <a href="#PartIX">ninth part</a> gives an account of the various improved
gas holders which have been invented, and now
are in action at the most recent establishments, for the
purpose of storing large quantities of gas. The improvements
that have been made in this department of
the Gas Light machinery, are particularly valuable and
have contributed more perhaps than any other, to lessen
the expence of manufacturing gas for commercial purposes.</p>

<p>In the <a href="#PartX">tenth part</a>, I have given a description of an
entirely new machine, called the gas-metre, or self-acting
guage, lately adopted at the Birmingham, Chester, and
other gas works, which measures and registers the
quantity of gas manufactured in any given time, from
any given quantity of coal, or consumed during any
period, by any number of burners or lamps. The great
services which such a machine must render both to the
manufacturer and consumer of gas, are particularly
pointed out, and illustrated to the manufacturer, by
serving as a complete check on his workmen as to the
quantity of work that ought to be performed, and to the
consumer, as an exact measure of the quantity of gas
he receives, and ought to pay for.</p>

<p>The <a href="#PartXI">eleventh part</a> is appropriated to the description of<span class="pagenum" id="Pagevii">[vii]</span>
another apparatus, called the governor, also of recent
invention, and now in use at numerous establishments.
The design of this machine is, to regulate the pressure of
the gas, before it enters into the mains, the importance of
which must be sufficiently manifest. I have also pointed
out the application of this apparatus for regulating the
magnitude of the flames of gas burners and lamps.</p>

<p>The <a href="#PartXII">twelfth part</a> treats on gas mains and branch pipes,
I have here stated the rules and practical proceedings
necessary to be observed, for applying and distributing
gas pipes to the greatest advantage.</p>

<p>The most efficient method of introducing the gas to the
interior of houses, forms the subject of <a href="#PartXIII">part thirteen</a>. All
the necessary instructions are here given to workmen, for
adapting the gas pipes, and insuring success at the least
cost, under every variety of circumstances.</p>

<p>The <a href="#PartXIV">fourteenth part</a> gives an account of the illuminating
power of coal gas&mdash;the quantity of gas consumed in
a given time, by different kinds of gas burners and lamps,
the relative cost of gas, tallow, and oil lights of different
intensities, and the most improved method employed for
ventilating apartments lighted by gas.</p>

<p>In the <a href="#PartXV">fifteenth</a> and <a href="#PartXVI">sixteenth parts</a>, I have added an
account of the manufacture of carburetted hydrogen gas,
from coal tar, vegetable tar, and oil, with such other
observations as may enable the reader to form a proper<span class="pagenum" id="Pageviii">[viii]</span>
estimate of the comparative advantage of manufacturing
gas from oil, or tar, under certain circumstances. I have
here also given an account of the manufacture of carbonate
of ammonia, as now practised, from the ammoniacal
liquor obtained in the Gas Light process, and of the
manufacture of other saleable products obtainable from
coal, namely; pitch, coal tar, and oil.</p>

<p>In conclusion I have to observe that my object throughout
has been to make the work a compendium of all the
best information which the practice of the art down to the
present moment has been able to afford, embodying a
great number of data, with which I have been obligingly
favoured by gentlemen, the most practically versant in
the art, and for which I beg they will individually accept
this public expression of my thanks, and obligations, as
well as the results which my own labours in this department,
neither few, nor inconsiderable have furnished.</p>

<p>To supply the reader with a work of practical utility in
a most valuable, and growing branch of national economy
has been my object; and I need scarcely add, that
the suffrages of the public to the zeal and industry at
least with which I have endeavoured to obtain that object,
will be a source of infinite satisfaction.</p>

<h3><i>General Nature and Advantages of the art of
procuring Light, by means of Carburetted
Hydrogen, or Coal Gas.</i></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="largecap">T</span>he new art of lighting houses, streets and
manufactories, with carburetted hydrogen, or coal
gas, is one of those modern discoveries on which
the admirers of science and the inhabitants of this
country in particular, have greater reason to congratulate
themselves, than any other invention or
discovery of the present age.</p>

<p>This art is so wonderful and important, it
speaks so forcibly by the effects it has already<span class="pagenum" id="Page2">[2]</span>
produced, that it cannot fail to increase the wealth
of the nation by adding to the number of internal
resources, as long as coal continues to be dug in
this island from the bowels of the earth.</p>

<p>For if we distribute the catalogue of human
wants which a civilized state of society has introduced,
the production and supply of artificial
light, holds next to food, clothing and fuel, the
most important place. We might indeed exist
without it, but how large a portion of our lives
would in that state be condemned to a state
little superior in efficacy to that of the animals
around us.</p>

<p>If we could for a moment suppose the privation
of artificial light, during the absence of the Sun,
it would follow as an immediate consequence that
the greatest part of the globe on which we dwell,
would cease to be the habitation of man. Whether
he could ensnare or overtake those animals upon
whose unprepared remains he would then be
compelled to feed; whether he might store the
fruits of the earth for his winter supply&mdash;what
might be the physical and moral consequences of
a state of such desolation, may perhaps be conjectured,<span class="pagenum" id="Page3">[3]</span>
but no estimate can show its dreadful magnitude.</p>

<p>How much do our comforts, and how greatly
does the extent of our power depend upon the
production and supply of artificial light. The flame
of a single candle animates a family, every one
follows his occupation, and no dread is felt of the
darkness of night. It might be a curious speculation
to enquire how far, and in what respect,
the morals of men would become degraded by the
want of this contrivance. But it is sufficient on
the present occasion, that, previous to entering
upon a dissertation respecting a new art of procuring
light, a train of ideas has slightly been
hinted at, which cannot fail to show its magnitude
and importance.</p>

<p>The progress of the new art of lighting houses,
streets and public buildings, by means of the inflammable
gas obtainable from coal, has been within
these few years uncommonly rapid. The number
of gas-lights already in use in the metropolis
alone, amounts to upwards of fifty-one thousand.
The total lengths of mains in the streets through
which the gas is conveyed from the gas-light<span class="pagenum" id="Page4">[4]</span>
manufactories into the houses, now measures two
hundred and eighty-eight miles.</p>

<p>The gas-light illumination has also spread far
and wide through the country. Establishments
for the supply of the new lights are carried on
at Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool, Bristol, Bath,
Cheltenham, Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester,
Exeter, Chester, Macclesfield, Preston, Kidderminster,
and in many other towns and places of
Great Britain.</p>

<p>Every body is now convinced that pitcoal is capable
of furnishing light superior to that obtained
from oil, wax, or tallow. The public attention is
awakened to the new value of coal, and will not
rest till the art of lighting with gas is pushed to
the utmost of its extent.</p>

<p>In order to arrive at a full and accurate knowledge
of the many advantages attending the application
of carburetted hydrogen or coal gas, as a
substitute for candles or lamps, it may be necessary,
especially for the information of those readers
who have never personally witnessed this mode
of illumination, to take a brief preliminary view
of some of the leading objects of public and private<span class="pagenum" id="Page5">[5]</span>
utility, to which this mode of procuring and distributing
light may be applied, and of the extent to
which it is entitled to national encouragement.</p>

<p>The chief advantages attending the use of gas,
are superiority and uniformity of light, saving
of labour, cleanliness, safety and cheapness.</p>

<p>It must be difficult for a person wholly unacquainted
with this art, to imagine with what facility
and neatness gas-lights are managed. The
gas being collected in a reservoir, is conveyed by
means of tubes, which branch out into smaller ramifications,
until they terminate at the places where
the lights are wanted. The extremities of the
branching tubes are furnished with burners,
having small apertures out of which the gas issues
with a certain velocity corresponding to its degree
of pressure. Near the termination of each tube,
there is a stopcock, or valve, upon turning which
when light is required, the gas instantly flows
out in an equable stream. There is no noise
at the opening of the valve, no disturbance
in the transparency of the atmosphere; the
gas instantly bursts on the approach of a lighted
taper into a peculiarly brilliant, soft and beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page6">[6]</span>
flame; it requires no trimming or snuffing to keep
the flame of an equal brightness. Like the light of
the Sun itself, it only makes itself known by the
benefit and pleasure it affords.</p>

<p>The gas flame is entirely free from smell. The
gas itself has a disagreeable odour before it is
burnt, and so has the vapour of wax, tallow and
oil, as it comes from a candle or lamp newly blown
out. This concession proves nothing against the
flame of gas, which is perfectly inodorous.</p>

<p>The gas-light flame is perfectly steady; a benefit
which persons accustomed to read or write by
candle-light, are particularly capable of appreciating.
With the other modes of illumination we
have never the light of the same intensity for two
minutes together, independent of that unpleasant
dancing unsteady flame which is so harassing to
the sight.</p>

<p>The size, form and intensity of the gas flame,
are regulated by simply turning the stop-cock
which admits the gas to the burner or lamp. The
flame may at command be made to burn with an
intensity sufficient to illuminate every corner of a
room, or so low and dim, as barely to be perceived.<span class="pagenum" id="Page7">[7]</span>
It is unnecessary to point out how valuable lights
of this description are in nurseries, stables, warehouses,
and chambers of the sick. From the
facility with which the gas flame can be conveyed
in almost any direction, from the diversified size
and shape which it can be made to assume, there
is no kind of light so well adapted for ornamental
illumination.</p>

<p>The flame of coal gas is of a pure white colour,
and of a body full and compact. In large masses,
it becomes of the same flickering character which
is common to all flames of large dimensions, and
is owing to the agitation of the surrounding heated
atmosphere.</p>

<p>The saving of labour connected with the
employment of gas-light, may seem on a small scale
to be trifling; but when it is considered that in
large manufactories, it is not unusual to find
several persons employed for no other purpose
than trimming the lamps or setting and snuffing
the candles of the establishment, the advantage
gained on this head by the use of a species of light
which require no sort of attention whatever, cannot
but appear very considerable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page8">[8]</span></p>

<p>The cleanliness of the gas-lights is also a consideration
of no small importance, they are attended
with none of that spilling of oil, and dropping of
grease, which makes the employment of oil-lamps
and candles so injurious in many warehouses, shops
and private dwellings.</p>

<p>The flame of a gas-light compared in point of
brilliancy to that of a candle, is as the flame of a
common oil lamp, compared to the flame of a lamp
of Argand. The difference between a street, on
the night of a general illumination, and any other
night when the street is under the dull glimmering
light of the ordinary oil lamps, is scarcely more
remarkable, than the difference between a street
lighted by gas, and one lighted by oil. While the
ordinary oil lamps may be said merely to serve the
purpose of making “<i>darkness visible</i>,” the gas-lights
really dispel the dominion of night, and
diffuse a body of light so wide-spreading and
intense, as almost to rival the clearest moonshine.</p>

<p>The same brilliancy which makes the gas-lights
of such utility out of doors, in lighting the streets,
has been found of equal advantage in illuminating
the interior of private dwellings, and large public<span class="pagenum" id="Page9">[9]</span>
buildings, such as churches, and theatres, &amp;c.
From a cluster of gas-lights, fewer by one-half than
the number of oil lamps and candles required for
lighting up a public edifice of this description in
the most ordinary manner, a body of light is furnished
which diffuses through the whole, a degree
of mellow clearness which is not to be attained by
the greatest number of oil lamps, or candles, which
a due regard to respiration will admit of being
employed. As examples of this, we have only
to name the public theatres of the metropolis,
all of which are lighted with gas, and in a manner
which excites universal admiration.</p>

<p>It may perhaps be imagined that with a substance
so inflammable, and amidst the blaze of resplendent
flame which produces such beautiful
effects, there is a peculiar risk of accidents by fire,
but so far is this from being the case, that gas-lights
are the safest of all lights. No danger can arise
from these lights in any way, but what is common
to candle lights and lamps of all kinds, and is the
fault of none of them. The gas-lights are in fact
a great deal less hazardous. There is no risk of
those accidents which often happen from the guttering<span class="pagenum" id="Page10">[10]</span>
of candles, from sparks being detached, or
from carelessly snuffing them. The gas-light
lamps and burners, must necessarily be fixed to
one place, and therefore cannot fall or otherwise
become deranged, without being immediately extinguished.
And further, at any time by shutting
the main tube which conveys the gas to the
burners and lamps, all the lights in the house can
be immediately extinguished. In short, where
gas is used, the master of the house, when he has
turned the main stop-cock which conveys the gas
into the collateral branch pipes, may retire to rest
free from any of those apprehensions, which before
harassed him, lest a candle might have been left
burning, of lest the accidental dropping of a spark
might become the cause of enveloping himself and
family in destruction.</p>

<p>But the best proof of the great safety of the
new lights is, that notwithstanding upwards of
fifty-one thousand gas-lamps burn nightly in
London, we have not heard of a single accident
occasioned by them, though the lamps and burners
are generally carelessly managed, while we have
too often occasion to lament the effects arising<span class="pagenum" id="Page11">[11]</span>
from sparks of candles, or carelessness in snuffing
them.</p>

<p>Hence the fire-insurance-offices engage to insure
manufactories and public works, at a less premium,
where gas is used, than when lighted by
other means.</p>

<p>The excessive expence of insurance, arising from
the numerous candles employed in most of the
first-rate manufacturing establishments, and the
combustible nature of the structure of the buildings;
the great difficulty of retrieving the injury
resulting to a well-organised business, from the
accidental destruction of the machinery, are considerations
alone sufficient to furnish the strongest
economical, as well as political recommendations,
for the adoption of the new lights in all manufactories
where work is done by candle-light.</p>

<p>We have as yet only adverted to the application
of gas in the more ordinary cases where light is
wanted, but among other special purposes to which
gas-lights may be applied, it would be improper to
overlook the peculiarly advantageous use which may
be made of them in the supplying of light-houses.
From the splendour and distinguishing forms<span class="pagenum" id="Page12">[12]</span>
which the gas-light flame is capable of assuming,
nothing can possibly be better calculated for such
a purpose; and in point of economy, the employment
of it would be attended with a saving of at
least one half of the ordinary expence of oil lights.
By means of a single furnace, as much gas may
be produced in three hours, as will furnish during
the longest winter night, a flame of greater brilliancy
than is now furnished by any lighthouse in
Britain, or indeed in the world. The body of
flame may be increased to any size, merely by
increasing the number of burners; and whatever
may be the magnitude of the flame, it will continue
to burn, without becoming in the least clouded
by smoke, or the reflectors being in the least
obscured. Should these considerations lead, as it
is to be hoped they will, to the actual employment
of gas in the lighthouses around the British islands,
it will readily occur, that in proportion as the gas
would be found attended with less expense than
the present mode of lighting by oil, it would
enable the commissioners for light-houses, out of
the surplus means which would be thus placed
at their disposal, to multiply the number of lighthouses,<span class="pagenum" id="Page13">[13]</span>
and thus to add most essentially to the
security of British navigation. Nor is it in the
case of maritime signal-lights alone, that the use
of gas is applicable, by its superior efficacy and
cheapness. The saving of expences to the country
which would be effected by the substitution of
coal gas, for oil and tallow in these and other
public establishments, is a consideration which
cannot be too much pressed on public attention.
The annual expenditure for lighting the barracks
of Great Britain alone, is said to fall little short of
fifty thousand pounds; for less than one half of
which sum, they might be lighted by means of
gas much better, and a great deal more safely.
Some idea may be formed from the practical saving
in this department&mdash;how great might be the total
saving, were this new mode of lighting adopted
in all our national establishments.</p>

<p>In the case of the public arsenals, however, the
saving from the employment of coal gas is a consideration
of far inferior importance to the <i>superior
security</i> attending it. On the preservation of the
stores which they contain may depend in a time of
war the whole chance of success against the enemy<span class="pagenum" id="Page14">[14]</span>
nor can any body who has lived in this country at
such a time have forgot the feverish alarm with
which the people have frequently seen this security
endangered by accidents arising from the use of
moveable lights. Were coal gas exclusively employed
in such establishments, the fixed position
which can be given to the burners, and the absence
of all danger from sparks must give a degree of
security to those places from fire, far beyond what
they at present possess, even when superintended
with the greatest possible caution and fidelity.</p>

<p>The same remark is equally applicable to the
government offices, public libraries, museums,
in short, to all public establishments where the
national value of the articles preserved is such that
no <i>possible</i> means of increasing their security from
destruction should be neglected.</p>

<p>We have now to turn our attention to another
general point of view in which the introduction of
lighting by gas is not less an object of interest to
the public; we allude to the application of gas as a
means of <i>heating</i> as well as lighting. Mr. Maiben<a id="FNanchor1"></a><a href="#Footnote1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page15">[15]</span>
was the first who directed the attention of the
public to this subject; he ascertained that gas from
coal gives nearly the same heat when put into
combustion, which is yielded by a third part of the
coal from which it is extracted. In other words,
it has been found that a quantity of fuel giving a
particular degree of heat, may be employed so as
to produce at the same time another substance
yielding nearly an equal degree of heat in a different
and more manageable form; a form in which it
can be preserved for any length of time, divided
into any portions, distributed in any direction,
consumed in an open fire-place, or in a stove concealed
in any shape; a form in which the flame may
issue equally well from iron or from stone-ware,
be instantly lighted up and instantly extinguished,
be made to burn as long or as short a time as may
suit us, and in any degree of intensity between the
most animating and brilliant blaze and its total
extinction; be extinguished in one room, and the
next moment lighted up in any other; in short
such a form, that by one proper arrangement from
the beginning, with the same portion of fuel, we
may at any time have the command of a chearful<span class="pagenum" id="Page16">[16]</span>
fire, an adequate and comfortable warmth in any
part of our dwelling to which we may have occasion
to move, as manageable, and in this way as portable,
as the taper by the touch of which it is kindled.
To those who have been accustomed to see before
them a solid mass of burning fuel, this gas flame
may at first have the less satisfactory appearance of
a fugitive blaze which we perceive nothing to support.
But its uniformity and permanence will
soon banish this impression, while it is attended
with other advantages not inconsiderable with
respect either to comfort or convenience. There
are no coals to be carried in, no ashes to be
carried out; there is no blowing, no sweeping of
cinders, no dust, no interruption of servants; there
is no excessive heat in one stage, no sudden
damping at another: we have the choice of any
temperature, and which we can regulate with the
utmost ease. The fire itself is lively and pleasant
to the eye: inclosed in transparencies it receives a
degree of splendour not easily imagined. Numerous
applications of gas, as a source of heat for
airing rooms, and other purposes, have already
been adopted. It is used in kitchens for keeping<span class="pagenum" id="Page17">[17]</span>
meat warm, and for boiling water; in store rooms,
in picture galleries, in libraries, for maintaining
them at an equal temperature. By copper-plate
printers, it is used for warming their plates; and
by jewellers and other artists, for soldering.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote1"></a><a href="#FNanchor1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> <i>A Statement of the
advantages to be derived from coal gas.</i>&mdash;p. 42.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>It remains further to be observed that the coal,
by yielding gas and other products, namely, tar,
pitch, and ammoniacal liquor, is not entirely lost.
It produces, besides light, an excellent fuel,
namely, coke; and as a manufactory, or workshop,
generally requires heating as well as lighting,
there is a gain both ways. The manufacturer,
by distilling his coal instead of burning it as it
comes from the pit, saves his candles and improves
his fuel. One effort at the outset in erecting
a gas apparatus, will reduce his annual disbursement
for those two articles of prime necessity,
much in the same manner, though in a greater
degree, as the farmer gains by building a thrashing
machine and laying aside the use of the flail.</p>

<p>The coal is so far from being reduced in consequence
of the gas-light process, to an useless
mass, that in many places immense quantities are
reduced to the state of coke for the purpose of rendering<span class="pagenum" id="Page18">[18]</span>
the coal a better fuel than it was in its natural
state; for coke gives a strong and lasting heat.
It is equally valuable for kitchen and parlour fires,
and still more as a necessary requisite in some
important branches of manufacture, so that in
whatever quantity coke may be produced, it can
never want a good market. The demand for coke
in this capital, since the establishment of the
gas-light works, has prodigiously increased.
Numerous taverns, offices, and public establishments,
which heretofore burnt coal, now use coke
to the total exclusion of coal; and in almost every
manufactory, which requires both extensive lighting
and heating, gas and coke are now the means
jointly employed. A coke fire emits a very uniform
and intense heat; it produces no sparks, and
burns free from soot and smoke; it requires no
trouble in managing, and to those who have the
misfortune of being plagued with a smoaky
chimney, affords the only certain cure.</p>

<p>Another valuable product is the tar which is
deposited during the production of the gas, this tar
when rectified by a slight evaporation, has become
an article of commerce. Large establishments,<span class="pagenum" id="Page19">[19]</span>
both of coal tar, coal oil, and pitch, are in full
action, and the commodities which they furnish
have become in great demand. The ammoniacal
liquor which the gas-light process affords, has of
late given rise to very important branches of
chemical manufacture, carried on upon a large
scale. But as the gas is at present supposed to be
the only object in view, for the sake of the light
which it yields, the other products being only
accidentally connected with its extraction, let us
leave the idea of profit on them out of the question,
and with the utmost latitude of concession, require
them only to stand as in part for a portion of the
coal employed in the process, we have still the
gas, an article which performs the functions of the
oil, the tallow, or the wax for which it is substituted;
and to the price of which we have no need to
call the attention of those who make use of them.
There remains only to be opposed on the other
side, the expence of the apparatus by which the
gas is to be prepared, and the lights maintained.
From the materials and the workmanship, with
the interest of the capital sunk, the expence in the
first instance, must be very considerable. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page20">[20]</span>
where the quantity of light must be great, even
from cheap substances, or where, with a less
quantity of light, the substances from which it is
derived must be of the costliest kind; such is
in either case the enormous expence of these
materials, that by superseding them and making
every reasonable allowance to the engineer who
erects the gas apparatus, the sum it costs, both
principal and interest, is soon liquidated, leaving
at last a total saving, excepting the expence of
accidental repairs, which, from the durability of
the materials employed, seldom exceeds a trifling
sum.</p>

<p>The principal expence in the pursuit of this new
branch of civil and domestic economy, is therefore,
the dead capital employed in erecting the machinery
for obtaining and conveying the gas. The
floating capital, after the first cost incurred in
erecting the apparatus, is comparatively small;
even if usurious interest is allowed for the first
cost of the apparatus, and its deterioration, the
saving must always be considerable, especially
if the number of lights furnished are comparatively
in a small place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page21">[21]</span></p>

<p>At the same time were we to offer advice to the
public on this subject, it would be, that no private
individual resident in London, should attempt to
light his premises, for the sake of economy, with coal
gas by means of his own apparatus, whose annual
expence for light does not exceed forty pounds.
But when a street, or small neighbourhood is
required to be lighted the operation may be commenced
with safety; the sum required for erecting
the apparatus, and the labour attending the process,
together with the interest of money sunk,
will then soon be liquidated by the light and other
products.</p>

<p>Individuals have accordingly engaged successfully
in the distillation of coal, and trade with
advantage in the articles produced by the process.</p>

<p>In like manner may the lighting of cities be
accomplished without the aid of incorporated
bodies; and parishes may be lighted by almost as
many individuals as there are streets in a
parish.</p>

<p>The supplying of light to the street or parish
lamps alone, of any district of street lamps only,
can never be undertaken with economy in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page22">[22]</span>
capital, nor indeed in any other; for the money
sunk in furnishing the mains or pipes only, must
always greatly exceed what any revenue from the
lighting of the streets alone can compensate.</p>

<p>The most beneficial application of gas-lights
unquestionably is in all those situations where a
great quantity of light is wanted in a small place;
and where light is required to be most diffused,
the profit of this mode of illumination is the least.
Hence, the lighting of the parish, or street-lamps
alone, without lighting shops or houses, can
never be done with economy.</p>

<p>It may be objected to the universality of our
conclusion that the price of coal differing very
much in different places will occasion a variation
in the expence of the new mode of lighting.</p>

<p>The price of coals can however have but little
effect upon the cost of the gas-lights; because the
very refuse, or small coal, which pass through the
screen at the pit’s mouth, and which cannot be
brought into the market, nay, even the sweepings
of the pit, which are thrown away, may be
employed for the production of coal-gas. It makes
no difference in what form the coal is used. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page23">[23]</span>
circumstance may contribute to enable coal-merchants
to furnish coals in larger masses, and as
they come from the mine, instead of increasing the
bulk by breaking them into a smaller size, which
is a practice commonly followed.</p>

<p>The demand which the gas-light occasions for
inferior sorts of coal may hereafter contribute to
lower the price of the superior kinds, and keep a
level which cannot be shaken under any circumstances.
It may contribute to prevent combinations
which do certainly operate to the prejudice
of the public, and sometimes put this great town
at the mercy of a few proprietors in the north,
who deal out this commodity in any way they
please. The competition thus produced, it is
impossible not to consider as an advantage, which
would tend to prevent such combinations, and put
the inhabitants of London out of the reach of them.</p>

<p>The advantages which the coal trade must reap
from the introduction of the gas-light must be very
considerable. There is already less waste, but a
greater consumption of coal than formerly. The
lower classes of the community are scantily supplied
with firing; and nothing but a reduction of<span class="pagenum" id="Page24">[24]</span>
price is necessary to increase to a very large
amount the average quantity of fuel consumed in
the country. The lightness of the coke produced
by the gas-light manufacture diminishing the
expence of land carriage, facilitates its general
diffusion&mdash;the comforts of the poor are becoming
materially augmented, and a number of useful
operations in agriculture and the arts are beginning
to be carried on, which have been hitherto
checked by the extravagant price of fuel. If any
additional vent were wanted for the coke, it would
readily be found in the continental market; coke
being better suited than coal to the habits of most
European nations.</p>

<p>Many, and unquestionable as are the advantages
of this new mode of procuring and distributing
light, it was not to be expected that an invention
which went to impair a branch of trade, in which
a large portion of skill and capital had hitherto
been successfully employed should escape encountering
very considerable opposition. On the first
introduction of the gas-lights, great but happily
unsuccessful endeavours were made to alarm the
public mind by dismal forebodings of the destruction<span class="pagenum" id="Page25">[25]</span>
which would ensue to the Greenland trade, and
the consequent loss of a valuable nursery of British
Seamen. When impartially considered it will be
found that there was nothing more in this objection
than the common clamour that is always set up
against every new means of abridging labour, to
which had the public listened, an interdict would
have been laid upon the spinning and threshing
machines, the steam engine, and a thousand other
improvements in machinery.</p>

<p>Such clamour scarcely ever fails to be made
when the extension of machinery, the application
of inanimate power, and the abridgment of labour
consequent on either, is a matter proposed. We
are then sure to be told that the scheme of
mechanical or chemical improvement is pointed
against the human species, that it tends to drive
them out of the system of beneficial employment and
that, on the whole, the sum of the improvement is
not only a less proportion of good to society, but a
positive accession of misery to the unemployed
poor.</p>

<p>The misfortune of this argument is that to be
good for any thing, it would prove a great deal<span class="pagenum" id="Page26">[26]</span>
too much. It is not confined in its scope to any
particular species or defined extent of improvement,
but is equally proscriptive of all improvements
whatever. It is a principle for savage life,
not for a state of civilization. It takes for its basis
that it is an advantage to perpetuate that necessity
for hard and incessant labour under which man
finds himself originally placed by nature, with all
the wants, privations, ignorance and ferocity,
which are attendant on that condition, and that
every discovery, invention, or improvement which
tends to abridge the quantity required of human
labour, and to augment the resources for living
and enjoyment is a serious injury to society. The
advocates of this narrow theory do not go the
whole length of maintaining that diminishing
labour, and increase of substance, are in themselves
positive evils, a position too absurd perhaps
for any one to uphold; but they maintain what
ends in a consequence nearly as untrue, namely,
that neither the one nor the other is of any advantage
to society at large. The palpable error of
this theory is, that it supposes that all improvements
which tend to supersede human labour, are<span class="pagenum" id="Page27">[27]</span>
necessarily made for the benefit of a few, and not
for the common benefit of the many; that instead
of lessening to each individual the share of labour
requisite to obtain the means of his subsistence,
their only tendency is to lessen the value of each
personas labour, and to oblige him to work more
in order to live equally well.</p>

<p>Now, however the existing state of things may
be in this country, or in other countries, arising
out of a variety of arbitrary circumstances, foreign
to the natural, and in all cases the ultimately
inevitable course of industry, it is a matter of justice,
clear and undeniable, that every improvement
in society ought to be the property of the many,
and not of a few; and that it ought either to lessen
the quantity of labour necessary for acquiring the
means of living, or to increase the profit to be
gained by continuing the same quantity of labour.
Nor does there seem any reason for believing that,
in point of fact, the actual distribution of things
is so far from according with this principle of
justice as some superficial and prejudiced observers
are fond of representing. The labourer, or artizan,
may now work a greater number of hours daily<span class="pagenum" id="Page28">[28]</span>
than he did years ago; but how seldom do we
find this to be the case without his comforts being
more than proportionally multiplied, and his
ultimate independence from labour essentially promoted.
In general, however, the fact is, if we
may give credit to well informed economists, that
the working classes do not labour more than
formerly, and yet live, or at least have the means
of living better; and that by working even less
than formerly, they can obtain the means of living
quite as well.</p>

<p>Let the real state of matters in this respect,
however, be as it may, the question comes to be one
merely as to the distribution of the produce of
nature and of art, and instead of opposing improvements
because they tend to encrease that produce,
the object of those who have really the good of
their fellow-creatures at heart, ought to be, to
encourage such improvements as much as possible,
but at the same time to obtain a correction of any
partiality or injustice which may have crept into
the distribution of their beneficial consequences.
It is not to be denied that all new improvements
which interfere with and change the occupations<span class="pagenum" id="Page29">[29]</span>
and habits of the working classes of people, must
at first expose them to inconvenience and distress,
against which it is in fairness the duty of society
to protect them; but let not that temporary inconvenience
and distress which can and ought to be
provided against, be held as an insuperable
obstacle to the adoption of an improvement the
ultimate tendency of which it is to better the condition
of mankind.</p>

<p>It is likewise true that the manufacturing classes
often suffer great want by the occasional suspension
of employment, and sometimes actual oppression,
by the demand for labour; but that involves
a question more immediately connected with
political economy than the present subject.</p>

<p>It is not the machinery that is in fault in such
cases, but those speculators who occasion an inordinate
excess of employment, or those statesmen
who, with their folly, derange the great machine
of human interests and intercourse.</p>

<p>Every invention which tends to diminish the
labour of men must be a benefit to the species;
and it is wicked to argue against the use of any
thing from its occasional abuse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page30">[30]</span></p>

<p>If the application of mechanical inventions thus
tends to improve the humanity of the public, if
it reduces the necessity of hard labour, and diminishes
the danger of many occupations which we
contend it does, they who contribute to this object
deserve our respect and gratitude.</p>

<p>It may be true that we have now no such minds
as those of Homer, or Bacon, or others of their
stamp; but we should reflect that the circumstances
which produced such characters are gone
by, and great faculties have found other objects
and other materials to work with.</p>

<p>The use of mechanical industry not only improves
and augments the comforts of domestic life,
but it also, perhaps, does as much to soften the
feelings of mankind towards one another as the
precepts of philosophy. It tends to engender a
detestation of hard labour, and to make the world
consider not what the labourer may be able to do
in tasking him, but what he ought to do without
detriment to himself. It effects this by withdrawing,
to a great degree, from observation, the
distressing spectacle of men and animals toiling
beyond their strength.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page31">[31]</span></p>

<p>It ought never to be forgotten, that it is to
manufactories carried on by machinery, and
abridgment of labour, that this country is indebted
for her riches, independence, and prominent station
among the nations of the world.</p>

<p>Authentic estimates have shewn, that the use of
machinery in Great Britain, is equivalent to an
addition to the population of upwards of <i>one
hundred millions of adult persons</i>.</p>

<p>This immense accession of power, has enabled
this country to withstand assaults, and to achieve
objects of political ambition, that appear almost
miraculous when compared with the geographical
extent and numerical population of the kingdom.</p>

<p>With respect to what has been advanced as to
the probable injury that would result from the
general adoption of the gas-lights all over the
country, to the Greenland trade, it may be observed
that the traffic might with more propriety be
called a drain than a nursery of the naval force.
The nature of the Greenland service requires that
the crew should consist of able bodied sailors;
and being protected men, not subject to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page32">[32]</span>
impress law, they are rendered useless for national
defence. The nursery of British seamen is the
coasting trade; and as the gas-light illumination
becomes extended it will increase that trade as
much as it diminishes the Greenland fishery.</p>

<p>Even on the extreme supposition that it would
annihilate the Greenland fisheries altogether, we
should have no reason to regret the event. The
soundest principles of political economy must
condemn the practice of fitting out vessels to
navigate the polar seas for oil, if we can extract a
superior material for procuring light at a cheaper
rate from the produce of our own soil. The consequence
of lighting our dwellings and manufactories
with gas can in fact prove injurious only to
our continental friends, one of whose staple
commodities, tallow, we shall then have less occasion
to purchase, although the new lights can
never supersede entirely the use of candles and
moveable lights.</p>

<h3><i>Outline of the new art of procuring light by
means of coal gas, and Theory of the production
of Gas Lights.</i></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="largecap">A</span>ll substances, whether animal, vegetable, or
mineral, consisting of carbon, hydrogen, and
oxigen, when exposed to a red heat, produce
various inflammable elastic fluids, capable of furnishing
artificial light.</p>

<p>The gases thus obtained are called carburetted
hydrogen; they produce, from their combustion,
water and carbonic acid. The species of carburetted
hydrogen, procured from pit-coal, has of
late been called <i>coal gas</i>.</p>

<p>We perceive the evolution of this elastic fluid,
during the combustion of coal, in a common fire.<span class="pagenum" id="Page34">[34]</span>
The coal, when heated to a certain degree, swells
and kindles, and frequently emits remarkably
bright streams of flame. And after a certain period
these appearances cease, and the coal glows with a
red light.</p>

<p>The flame produced from coal, wood, turf, oil,
wax, tallow, or other bodies, which are composed
of carbon, hydrogen and oxigen, proceeds from
the production of carburetted hydrogen gas, evolved
from the combustible body when in an ignited
state.</p>

<p>It must have been noticed at the same time, that
in the common mode of burning coal in a fire-place,
or stove, nearly the whole of this inflammable
gaseous matter is lost. We often see a flame
suddenly burst from the densest smoke, and as
suddenly disappear; and if a light be applied to
the little jets that issue from the bituminous part
of the coal, they will catch fire and burn with a
bright flame. The fact is, that the greater part of
the carburetted hydrogen gas, capable of affording
light and heat, continually escapes up the chimney,
during the decomposition of the coal, whilst only<span class="pagenum" id="Page35">[35]</span>
a small part is occasionally ignited, and exhibits
the phenomena of the flame.</p>

<p>If coal instead of being burnt in the way
now stated, is submitted at a temperature of ignition
in close vessels, all its immediate constituent
parts may be collected. The bituminous part is
melted out in the form of coal tar, there is disengaged
at the same time a large quantity of an
aqueous fluid, contaminated with a portion of oil,
and various ammoniacal salts. A large quantity
of carburetted hydrogen, carbonic oxide, carbonic
acid, and sulphuretted hydrogen also makes their
appearance, and the fixed base of the coal, alone
remains behind in the distillatory apparatus, in
the form of a carbonaceous substance called <i>coke</i>.
An analysis of the coal is thus effected by the process
of destructive distillation. The products which
the coal furnishes may be separately collected in
different vessels. The carburetted hydrogen, or
coal gas, when freed from the foreign gases may
be propelled in streams out of small apertures,
which when lighted may serve as a flame of a
candle and then form what we now call <span class="smcap">Gas
Lights</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page36">[36]</span></p>

<p>It is in this manner that from pitcoal a production
of our own soil, we procure a pure, lasting
and brilliant light, which in other cases must be
derived from materials in part imported from
abroad.</p>

<p>In order to apply this mode of procuring light
on a large scale as now practised with unparalleled
success in this country, the coal is put into
vessels called retorts and furnished with pipes
connected with reservoirs to receive the distillatory
products. The retorts are fixed into a
furnace, and heated to redness. The heat developes
from the coal the gaseous and liquid
products, the latter are deposited into receivers,
and the former are conducted through water in which
quick lime is diffused by which the carburetted
hydrogen gas is purified. The sulphuretted hydrogen
and carbonic acid which were mixed with
it, become absorbed by the quick-lime, and the
pure carburetted hydrogen is stored up in a vessel
called the gas-holder, and is then ready for
use.</p>

<p>From the reservoir in which the gas has been
collected, proceed pipes, which branch out into<span class="pagenum" id="Page37">[37]</span>
smaller ramifications until they terminate at the
place where the lights are wanted and the extremities
of the branch pipes are furnished with stop-cocks
to regulate the flow of the gas into the
burners or lamps.</p>

<p>The production of gas-lights, is therefore analogous
to that of flame produced from tallow, wax,
or oil. All these substances possess, in common
with coal, the elements of certain peculiar matters,
which are capable of being converted into inflammable
elastic fluids by the application of heat.</p>

<p>The capillary tubes, formed by the wick of a
candle, or lamp, serve the office of the retorts, placed
in the heated furnace in the gas-light process and in
which the inflammable gaseous fluid is developed.
The wax tallow or oil, is drawn up into these
ignited tubes, and is decomposed into carburetted
hydrogen gas, and from the combustion of this
substance the illumination proceeds. In the lamp as
well as in the candle, the oil, or tallow, must therefore
be decomposed before they can produce a light,
but for this purpose the decomposition of a minute
quantity of the materials successively, is sufficient to<span class="pagenum" id="Page38">[38]</span>
give a good light. Thus originates the flame of a
candle or lamp.</p>

<p>Nothing more therefore is aimed at in the gas-light
process, than to separate the immediate products
which coal affords, when submitted to a temperature
of ignition in a close vessel; to collect
these products in separate reservoirs, and to convey
one of the products, the inflammable gas, by means
of pipes and branching tubes, to any required
distance, in order to exhibit it there at the orifice of
the conducting tube, so that it may be used as a
candle or lamp.</p>

<p>The whole difference between the gigantic
process of the gas light operation, and the miniature
operation of a candle or lamp, consists in having
the distillatory apparatus at the gas-light manufactory,
instead of being in the wick of a candle or
lamp. In having the crude inflammable matter
decomposed previous to the elastic fluid being
wanted, and stored up for use, instead of being
prepared and consumed as fast as it proceeds from
the decomposed oil, wax or tallow; and lastly, in
transmitting the gas to any required distance, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page39">[39]</span>
igniting it at the burner or lamp of the conducting
tube, instead of burning it at the apex of the wick.
The principle of the gas-light manufacture is therefore
rational, and justifiable by the general mode in
which all light is produced.</p>

<p>It only remains to be observed that while the
new and important use to which pitcoal may
thus be applied, affords a strong confirmation of
what has been well observed, that of all subterraneous
combustible substances, coal is in this
country by far the most important natural production.<a id="FNanchor2"></a><a href="#Footnote2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
“It is connected not only with the
necessities, comforts and enjoyments of life, but
also with the extension of our most important arts,

<h3><i>Classification of Pit-coal, and maximum quantity
of gas, obtainable from different kinds of
Coal.</i></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="largecap">W</span>e have stated already that pitcoal is in this
country the cheapest crude natural production
from which carburetted hydrogen gas can be
obtained in the large way. It is that which yields
it in abundance, and which can with the least
trouble and expence be subjected to the operation
it has to undergo for the production of the gas.<a id="FNanchor3"></a><a href="#Footnote3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Nature has dealt this mineral out to us, with an
unsparing hand, and has provided mines of coal
which seem to defy the power of man to exhaust.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote3"></a><a href="#FNanchor3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
Other Substances from which carburetted hydrogen gas, may be
economically obtained, are animal and vegetable oil, tar, both vegetable
and coal tar; pitch, resin, the essential oils obtainable from vegetable
and from coal tar, and the compact species of turf. On this
subject we shall speak hereafter.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page42">[42]</span></p>

<p>The principal coal mines in England are those
near Newcastle and Whitehaven. The town of
Newcastle stands on beds of coal which extend to a
considerable distance round the place, and which
as far as concerns many hundred generations after
us, may be pronounced inexhaustible.</p>

<p>Pitcoal like all other bituminous substances is
composed of a fixed carbonaceous base in the state
of bitumen, united to a small portion of earthy
and saline matter, which constitute the ashes left
behind when the coal is burnt. The proportions
of these parts differ considerably in different kinds
of coal; and according to the prevalence of one or
other of them, so the coal is more or less combustible,
passing by various shades from the most
inflammable coal into blind coal, Kilkenny coal, or
stone coal, and lastly into a variety of earthy, or stony
substances, which although they are inflammable
do not merit the appellation of coal.</p>

<p>All the varieties of coal used in this country for
fuel may be divided into the following classes.</p>

<p>The first class comprehends those varieties which
are chiefly composed of bitumen only, which
take fire easily, and burn briskly with a strong and<span class="pagenum" id="Page43">[43]</span>
yellowish white blaze, which do not swell or cake
on the fire, and require no stirring, which produce
no slag, and by a single combustion are reduced to
light white ashes. Some of this species of coal
when suddenly heated crackle and split into pieces,
especially if laid on the fire in the direction of the
cross fracture of their laminæ.</p>

<p>Cannel coal, deserves to be placed at the head of
this class; next to this, we may rank all those
descriptions of coal known in the London market
by the names of Hartley, Cowper’s Main, Tanfield
Moor, Eighton Main, Blythe, and Pont Tops. It
also includes the sort of coals found in several parts
of Scotland, called Splent coal, and some of those
raised on the Western Coast of England.</p>

<p>Most of the coals raised in Staffordshire ought likewise
to be classed among this species of coal, but the
line of distinction between these, and the classes
subsequently named, cannot be accurately drawn.</p>

<p>The following table exhibits the maximum
quantity of gas obtainable from the first class of
coal.<a id="FNanchor4"></a><a href="#Footnote4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

Most varieties afford a porous, and very friable coke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page45">[45]</span></p>

<p>The second class of coal, comprehends all
those varieties which contain a less quantity of
bitumen, and a larger quantity of carbon than the
first class. They burn with a flame less bright and
of a more yellowish colour, and the last portion of
flame they are capable of yielding is always of a
lambent blue colour, they become soft after having
laid on the fire for some time, swell in bubbles and
pass into a state of semi-fusion, they then cohere and
coke, puff up and throw out tubercular scoriæ,
with a hissing noise, accompanied with small jets of
flame.</p>

<p>In consequence of the agglutination and tumefaction,
the passage of air, if this sort of coal be
burnt in an open grate, is interrupted, the fire burns
as it is called hollow, and would become extinguished
if the top of the coal were not from time
to time broken into with the poker.</p>

<p>The coke formed from this species of coal is more
compact than that produced from the first sort of
coal, and is well calculated for standing the blast
of bellows in metallurgical operations. In respect
to weight the second class of coal is considerably
heavier than those of the first class, the difference<span class="pagenum" id="Page46">[46]</span>
amounts to not less than from twenty-eight
pounds to thirty-three pounds in the sack of
coal. A chaldron of some varieties of this class
of coal, if the coals are in large lumps, weighs
upwards of twenty-eight hundred weight.</p>

<p>The usual denomination by which the second
class of coal is known in the London market, is that
of <i>strong burning coal</i>. The following varieties
are sufficiently known, Russel’s Walls-End;
Bewick’s and Craister’s Walls-End; Brown Walls-End,
Wellington Main, Temple Main, Heaton
Main, Killingsworth Main, Percy Main, Benton
Main, and some varieties of the Swansea coal.</p>

<p>The smaller kinds of coal of this class are
preferred by smiths, because they stand the blast
well. They make a caking fire so as to form
a kind of hollow, space or oven, as the workmen
call it. Some varieties abound in pyrites, and
others are intersected with thin layers of slate and
lime-stone. They require more heat for being
carbonized than the first class, and the fluid
obtained from it by distillation, contains a considerable
portion of carbonate, sulphate, and hydrosulphuret
of ammonia. They are well calculated<span class="pagenum" id="Page47">[47]</span>
for the production of coal gas; the coke which they
produce is not very brittle, and will bear moving
from place to place, without crumbling into dust.</p>

<p>The third and last class of coals includes
those which are destitute of bitumen, being
chiefly composed of carbon in a peculiar state of
aggregation, evidently combined chemically with
much earthy matter. Coals of this class require a
still higher temperature to become ignited than
any of the former classes, they emit little or no
smoke. When laid on a fire they burn away with
a feeble lambent flame, indeed some varieties give
no flame at all, but burn merely with a red glow,
somewhat like charcoal, and at length become consumed
without caking. They leave a small portion
of heavy ashes.</p>

<p>When submitted to distillation they afford little
or no tar; of a consistence almost resembling
pitch, and a gaseous fluid chiefly composed of
gaseous oxide carbon and hydrogen gas. It is
scarcely necessary to add that they are altogether
unfit to be employed for the manufacture of coal
gas. The Kilkenny, Welch, and stone or hard coal
belong to this class. They require a strong draught
when burnt in an open fire-grate, and the large
quantity of gaseous oxide of carbon which they
furnish during their combustion is extremely offensive.<span class="pagenum" id="Page49">[49]</span>
This is particularly the case with Kilkenny
coal. The Welch stone or hard coal is better
adapted for culinary purposes, and there is reason
to believe that this species of coal might be rendered
useful in the smelting of iron ore, by a
slight modification in the metallurgic process employed
for extracting the metal from its ore, but to
eradicate prejudice, and to alter established practices
is a work which nothing but time can effect.
This species of coal is sent all over the kingdom;
it is well calculated for the operations of drying malt
and hops, and its small coal or culm has been found
a more economical fuel, than Newcastle and Sunderland
coals, for the burning of lime and bricks,
and for all other processes where no blazing fuel is
required.</p>

<p>When we consider the before mentioned varieties
of coal in an economical point of view, as fuel to
be used in the gas-light process, for heating the
retorts, it appears from a series of experiments that
have been made under my direction, that the
second class of coal comprehending those varieties
which contain a larger quantity of carbon than
bitumen (<a href="#Page45">p. 45</a>,) afford the most economical fuel,
they act less on the grate bars, and fire bricks of
the furnace than those varieties which take fire
easily and burn briskly with a strong blaze. A
mixture of Welch Stone coal, and Newcastle coal
forms an excellent economical fuel, where an intense
glowing fire is required.</p>

<h3><i>Form and dimensions of the Retorts originally
employed for manufacturing Coal Gas.</i></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="largecap">T</span>he proper mode of constructing the retorts
in which the coal is distilled, and the art of applying
them form an object of primary importance
in every gas-light establishment. According as the
manufacture is conducted in these respects with a
due regard to physical principles, depends the
quantity of gas which can be obtained in any given
time, from any given quantity of coal, the consumption
of fuel requisite for the production of
that quantity of gas, the degree of deterioration to
which the distillatory vessel is subjected, the quality
in some measure, of the gas itself; and, as the
ultimate result of all these circumstances, the cheapness
at which the gas light can be furnished to the
consumer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page52">[52]</span></p>

<p>The essential influence of these various particulars
on the value of the art of lighting with coal
gas, has led to much assiduous enquiry to ascertain
that sort of construction and mode of operation in
respect to each of them which may be most advantageous.
And in no branch of the new art of procuring
light, has a greater variety of plans of improvement
been submitted to the several directing
boards of gas works, or more labour and expence
been incurred in experiments conducted on a large
scale, to ascertain the relative merits of these plans.
Nor is there any part of the gas-light process in
which a greater number of material alterations
have been put in practice.</p>

<p>In the earlier periods of lighting with coal gas
the retorts employed at some of the gas-light establishments
in the metropolis, were hollow cast-iron
cones from six to seven feet in length. The
greatest diameter of the cone which formed the
mouth of the retort, measured from twelve to
fifteen inches, and its smallest diameter at the
vertex from nine to ten inches.</p>

<p>At other gas works the form of the retort was a
parallelopiped from six to seven feet long, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page53">[53]</span>
horizontal, and vertical sides were respectively
to each other, as 20 to 15 inches. The angles of
these retorts were slightly rounded. Fig. 16, <a href="#PlateV">plate
V.</a> exhibits a vertical section of this retort.</p>

<p>Again at other establishments semi-cylindrical
retorts, placed horizontally upon their flat surfaces
were employed; fig. 18. <a href="#PlateV">pl. V.</a> The length of these
retorts was from five to six feet, and their vertical
and horizontal diameters were to each other as
6 inches, to 18 inches. And at a few establishments,
ellipsoidal retorts, fig. 17, <a href="#PlateV">plate V.</a> were
used; these measured from five feet and a half, to
six feet in length, their major and minor axes bore
different proportions to each other at different establishments.
At the first adoption of these retorts,
the proportions varied but little from the cylinder,
but subsequently the difference between the major
and minor axes became gradually increased till at
last the major axis has become to the minor axis,
as 20 to 10 inches, and at some gas works the
proportions are as 25 to 10 inches.</p>

<p>With vessels of these forms the distillatory process
was carried on for some years, and the quantity of
fuel employed to decompose a given quantity of<span class="pagenum" id="Page54">[54]</span>
coal by means of them, amounted to from thirty to
thirty-six per cent.</p>

<p>When the dimensions of the retorts were increased,
both the quantity of fuel and time required
for the decomposition of a given quantity of coal
was in a far greater ratio; and the operations of
charging and discharging the retorts, very troublesome.</p>

<p>Retorts of smaller dimensions have likewise been
tried, but the more frequent charging and discharging,
which they require, occasioned such a
waste of time and labour, and such intermissions,
in the temperature necessary for the process of
distillation, (besides being attended with other
disadvantages which will be afterwards explained),
that they were speedily discontinued at the gas
works where they had been adopted.</p>

<p>The use of conical retorts, as well as of those of
a semi-cylindrical and parallelopipedal form, has of
late been discontinued in most establishments.
The conical shape not only diminishes the capacity
of the vessel, but also renders it incapable of
being heated economically.</p>

<p>From two comparative series of operations<span class="pagenum" id="Page55">[55]</span>
made on a large scale, and continued for upwards
of six months with conical and cylindrical retorts,
with a view to determine the comparative power of
these vessels, it has been proved that the same
quantity of gas which can be obtained by means of
forty conical retorts, may be procured in the same
time and with the same quantity of coal and fuel,
by means of thirty-four cylindrical retorts.<a id="FNanchor10"></a><a href="#Footnote10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote10"></a><a href="#FNanchor10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a>
These Experiments were made at the commencement of the new
art of lighting with gas, at the Westminster Chartered Gas Works, by
Messrs. Grant and Hargraves.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Similar experiments have been undertaken,
to determine the comparative action of semi-cylindrical
and parallelopipedal retorts.<a id="FNanchor11"></a><a href="#Footnote11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The
latter, when kept in action day and night, do not
long retain their shape; their sides collapse, their
capacity becomes diminished, their angular form
causes the heat to act upon them unequally, in
whatever manner it may be applied, in consequence
of which they suffer more deterioration
in some parts than in others. Besides, they require
a much larger proportion of fuel for decomposing<span class="pagenum" id="Page56">[56]</span>
a certain quantity of coal than the cylindrical
retorts.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote11"></a><a href="#FNanchor11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> At the Birmingham Gas Works.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Semi-cylindrical retorts, with the base of the
retort bent inwards, so as to give the vessel a
kidney-shaped form, have likewise been tried.
But this shape is still less advantageous; they
could not be made to work uniform, they required
more heat, and their deterioration was more rapid
than cylindrical retorts. They could not be kept
fit for use when worked day and night, more
than about five months. And with regard to
ellipsoidal retorts, it must be confessed, that the
experiments that have as yet been made upon a
large scale to ascertain their powers, are not of
a nature to enable us to decide on their merits.
No experiments have been carried on with retorts
of this description in the metropolis for a sufficient
length of time, with that care and attention
which the subject demands, to ascertain their
comparative power. From what however has been
done, there is reason to believe that ellipsoidal
retorts, might be found more advantageous, than
those of a cylindrical form now in use. An ellipsoidal
retort, 20 inches by 10 in diameter, and six
feet long, weighs 14 Cwt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page57">[57]</span></p>

<p>The reader will thus observe, that of all the
forms of retorts which have been hitherto fairly
tried, upon a large scale, it has been satisfactorily
ascertained, (excepting only as to the ellipsoidal
retorts), that the cylinder is the best form for
decomposing coal in masses, from five to eight or
ten inches in thickness.</p>

<p>It is perhaps needless to state that in making
experiments on the comparative value of the best
form of cast-iron retorts, it is obvious that the
operations should be continued for some months
uninterruptedly; no conclusion can be drawn that
may become practically useful in the large way,
from processes carried on for a few weeks only.
It is absolutely essential that the comparative trials
be continued for months together, and that the
inferences be taken from the total quantity of coal
used during that period, compared with the total
quantity of gas obtained, the deterioration of the
retorts, and the time and labour expended.</p>

<p>Proceeding on erroneous data, many have
persuaded themselves of having noticed that
parallelopipedal and semi-cylindrical retorts last<span class="pagenum" id="Page58">[58]</span>
longer fit for use than those of a cylindrical shape,
an assertion of which subsequent trials, conducted
in the manner just stated, has clearly shown the
fallacy. Enough has been done at the different gas
works in the capital to settle this point, and there
is now but one opinion amongst those who are
best qualified to judge of the subject. Every body
who has made the trial on a large scale, is convinced
as already stated, that the best form of the
retort for manufacturing coal gas where the process
is conducted on the plan of decomposing coal in
masses or layers of from four to eight inches
in thickness, is a cylinder six and a half feet long,
and one foot in diameter, and accordingly retorts
of this shape and dimensions are now used in all
the best regulated gas establishments in the metropolis.</p>

<p>A cylindrical retort of the description before
named, weighs about nine and a half to ten hundred
weight. These and all other shaped retorts
are furnished with a moveable lid or cover having
a conical edge to fit the mouth-piece; the cover
is rendered air-tight, not as formerly by grinding,<span class="pagenum" id="Page59">[59]</span>
a mode which was costly, but by the interposition
of a thin coat of loom, between the lid and
the mouth of the retort.</p>

<p>The mouth-piece forms a separate part of the
retort. It is bolted and screwed to a flanch which
terminates the mouth of the retort, so that when
the retort is worn out, the mouth-piece may be
detached and applied to new retorts.</p>

<p>There are now in action 620 cylindrical retorts,
at the two chartered Gas Works<a id="FNanchor12"></a><a href="#Footnote12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> in the metropolis;
and the total number of retorts at all the
London gas establishments amounts to 960.</p>

<h3><i>Application of heat.&mdash;Flue Plan originally
adopted.</i></h3>

<p>It must be obvious that the durability of the
distillatory apparatus, greatly depends on the
manner in which the heat is applied, to effect the
decomposition of the coal contained within the<span class="pagenum" id="Page60">[60]</span>
retort. If the heat be very intense the whole vessel
is rapidly destroyed. If it be too languid, the
distillatory process is protracted, and much fuel,
time, and labour wasted to no purpose; and the
retort is speedily deteriorated, if the heat acts upon
one part of it more than upon another.</p>

<p>The different kind of retorts of which a description
has been given in the preceding pages, were
originally heated by means of flues passing under
and over them. The retorts were placed horizontally
and fixed in brick-work. One fire-place
at the extremity of the mouth of the retort where the
coals are introduced, and whence the coke is
withdrawn, was allotted to every two retorts in the
series.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the new art of procuring
light the quantity of fuel as before stated,
necessary to decompose a given quantity of coal,
amounted to from thirty to thirty-six per cent of
the coal decomposed; that is to say, it required
from thirty to thirty-six parts of fuel to decompose
one hundred parts of coal. This quantity has
been much lessened by a better mode of setting
the retorts, and it is now the general opinion that<span class="pagenum" id="Page61">[61]</span>
the operation of decomposing coal, by means of
cylindrical, parallelopipedal, or semi-cylindrical retorts,
must be considered as well conducted when
one hundred parts of coal are decomposed by
twenty or twenty-five parts of fuel. This appears
to be the minimum quantity of fuel, that can be
employed for the complete decomposition of coal
by means of these retorts, and with the least deterioration
of the distillatory vessel.</p>

<p>The following statement will exhibit what has
been done in this branch of art.</p>

<h3><i>Report on a course of Operations, made with
sets of 66, of 30, of 116, and of 64 retorts,
worked on the Flue Plan.</i></h3>

<p>In order to determine the relative value of the
best method of setting cast-iron retorts, it was
deemed necessary to ascertain whether three retorts
might not be heated, instead of two, as before
stated, by one fire-place and branching flues. To
determine this the following processes were carried
into effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page62">[62]</span></p>

<h4><i>Process I.</i></h4>

<p>Sixty-six cast-iron cylindrical retorts, of the usual
size, namely, six and a half feet long, (exclusive
of the mouth-piece) and one foot in diameter, internal
dimensions, where set on the plan of three
retorts to one fire-place, at the Westminster gas-work
station, and a series of 30 similar retorts
were erected at another station belonging to the
same company, at the East end of London.</p>

<p>The experiments were pursued with every degree
of justice in the detail, the retorts were kept in
action day and night for upwards of four months,
and the results noted down with exactness. The
final reports from the two establishments were
found to concur in showing that nothing was to be
gained by this method over that previously in use.</p>

<p>The time occupied for the distillatory process
was not abridged. The consumption of fuel was
greater&mdash;no larger quantity of gas was obtained
from the quantity of coal carbonized. The produce
with regard to coke was in the usual ratio,
and the retorts were destroyed in about one third
less time than when only two were heated by one
fire-place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page63">[63]</span></p>

<h4><i>Process II.</i></h4>

<p>The apparently conclusive results of these experiments
did not, however, prevent another set of
experiments from being made on the same principle,
extended even a degree farther. The problem
now proposed to be solved, was, whether four retorts
might not be heated with economy, in a manner
which had been found already wasteful with
respect to three, that is, whether four instead of two
retorts might not be heated economically by means
of one fire-place.</p>

<p>On this plan one hundred and sixteen cylindrical
retorts of the usual dimensions were again erected
at the Westminster gas establishment, and sixty-four
at another station belonging to the same
chartered company. These retorts were kept in
action in the best possible manner night and day,
and the results, as might have been anticipated,
only served to confirm the facts already established
by experiment with three retorts.</p>

<p>Nothing was found to be gained; and so far
from their being any saving in respect of fuel and
wear and tear of the retorts, the waste beyond that
which takes place on the plan of two retorts to one<span class="pagenum" id="Page64">[64]</span>
fire-place, was increased to nearly twenty-five per
cent., accompanied by a corresponding acceleration
of injury to the retorts.</p>

<p>It was still imagined, however, that the great
waste of fuel and the ultimate unfavourable result
of these proceedings, which were repeated with as
little success at several other gas-works in the
metropolis with parallelopipedal retorts, and at
other works with retorts of a semi-cylindrical form,
set in a way different from that pursued at the
Westminster station, might probably have been
owing to the unavoidable circumstance, that the
heat was not made to act upon all the retorts employed
uniformly in each series of four retorts,
but in a manner so variable that one, or even two
of the series would become destroyed and rendered
useless, while the others continued uninjured in a
sound and working state.</p>

<p>The excessive waste of fuel was occasioned, we
are told, by the number of injured retorts, which
became useless, and were nevertheless required to
be kept red hot to no purpose; for it was actually
found that when one retort of a series of four
became injured, the same fire which had heated<span class="pagenum" id="Page65">[65]</span>
the whole four, still required to be kept up to
maintain in action the remaining three of the series,
and so on with respect to the whole range, till
ultimately when there might remain only eighty
retorts actually in use, as many fire-places were
required to be in full action as would have been
sufficient to serve for one hundred retorts.</p>

<p>Attempts accordingly were now made to get over
this supposed cause of the losing results, already
obtained from the plan of four retorts to one fire-place,
by a new series of similar operations, in
which the retorts were fixed in such a manner, that
those which happened to become injured during
the process, might easily and immediately be withdrawn
without materially disturbing the rest, and
replaced by new ones. The waste of fuel was, it
is clear, greatly lessened by the expedient; yet
still upon the whole there was no such variation
from the general results obtained by the preceding
experiments, as to justify the adoption of this plan
of increasing the number of retorts worked by one
fire-place, on any principle of sound economy.</p>

<p>The great obstacle, as the reader will at once
perceive, to working more than two retorts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page66">[66]</span>
no matter whether cylindrical, or of any of the other
forms before named, with economy, by means of
one fire-place, evidently arose from the difficulty of
conducting the heat by means of flues around
the series of retorts, in such a manner that
the heat shall act with equal force on all the
retorts.</p>

<p>It is almost needless to state, that the construction
of the fire-places, and the direction of the flues for
applying the heat to the retorts, were varied by
different workmen, who prided themselves on being
able to aid the object in view, but the result always
showed even that when the draft of the fire-place was
well obtained, the action of the heat upon the series
of retorts could not be distributed equally and kept
up uniformly, except at a great expence of fuel and
vast deterioration of the distillatory vessels. The
retorts always became injured more in some parts
than in others. The concentration and rapidity of
the draught of the fire, beyond a certain velocity was
always found highly injurious to the retort, and this
observation has been since amply confirmed.</p>

<p>In a well constructed furnace, the deterioration
of all the retorts in the series is uniform over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page67">[67]</span>
whole vessel; no part of the retort is <i>burnt out</i>, as
the workmen call it, sooner than another part;
and whenever the contrary happens, we may pronounce
the fire to be badly applied. When there
is such misapplication of the heat, the manufacturer
cannot depend upon the duration of the distillatory
vessel; he is always in a state of uncertainty
with regard to their wear and tear, and it
not unfrequently has happened, under such circumstances,
that a whole series of retorts have
become suddenly deteriorated.</p>


<h3><i>Oven plan lately adopted.</i></h3>

<p>The results before detailed, with regard to the
mode of setting cylindrical retorts suggested the
propriety of an entire change in the mode of
applying the heat, and this was at length fully
carried into effect by the adoption of ovens, or air
furnaces, in which the retorts are equally exposed
to the action of heat on all sides. Mr. Rackhouse
has the merit of having first carried into effect this
method, since generally known by the name of
the <i>oven plan</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page68">[68]</span></p>

<p>The first experiments with these ovens were
made on only one retort, exposed in an oven to
air intensely heated; but they were afterwards
repeated on two, three, four, and five retorts, successively.
The retorts suffered the action of heat
thus applied, exceedingly well; their deterioration
was uniform, and the quantity of fuel required to
work them, was found always to be in a direct
ratio to the number of retorts employed. These
experiments were carried on for upwards of nine
months, and it was found, that with five retorts
in one oven, so that the heated air could act upon
all of them equally, without the flame being directed
forcibly upon them, this plan had a decided advantage,
in point of economy, over every other method
previously adopted. Each oven, containing five retorts,
is heated by means of three fire-places, and although
it is true that the number of retorts is less by
one, than what could have been heated by three fire-places,
on the original plan of two retorts to one fire,
yet still this method has been found to be far more
productive. The front wall of the oven may be
readily taken down so that a retort, when damaged,<span class="pagenum" id="Page69">[69]</span>
may be withdrawn, and replaced without materially
disturbing the rest.</p>

<p>The oven plan of applying heat has been found
equally advantageous for parallelopipedal and semi-cylindrical
retorts.<a id="FNanchor13"></a><a href="#Footnote13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

The only gas-light establishment of great extent in the metropolis,
at which parallelopipedal retorts are still in use, is the <i>South London
Gas Works</i>. But it is solely owing to the very peculiar care
and economy with which all the details of this establishment are
conducted, under the immediate superintendence of a few active, skilful
and scientific proprietors, that they are able to compensate for the
loss, which in all ordinary cases is inseparable from the employment
of vessels of that description.</p>

<h3><i>Description of the Retort Oven.</i></h3>

<p>Fig. 1, <a href="#PlateIV">plate IV.</a>, represents a transverse section
of one of the retort ovens now in action at the
Westminster Chartered Gas-Light Company’s
Works; similar ovens are likewise in use at the
City of London Chartered Gas-Light Works, and
in many other provincial gas establishments.</p>

<p>Fig. 2, <a href="#PlateIV">plate IV.</a>, exhibits a longitudinal section,
and fig. 1, <a href="#PlateV">plate V.</a> shows the front elevation of the
oven, built about ten feet above the ground, upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page70">[70]</span>
piers or arches, which saves brick-work and allows
a stage or platform to be erected in front of the
fire-places of the ovens. See fig. 2, <a href="#PlateIV">plate IV.</a></p>

<p>Between the back part of the ovens and the wall
of the building in which they are erected, is left
an empty space of a few inches to prevent the
heat of the oven being communicated to the
wall, as is seen at Y in fig. 2, <a href="#PlateIV">plate IV.</a></p>

<p>The whole interior of the oven, as well as the
horizontal flue which pass underneath the crown
of it, near the upper tier of retorts, is lined with
fire bricks. The uppermost part or crown of the
arch is constructed of large fire bricks of such a
shape as will allow to flatten the upper part of the
arch as much as possible, in order to contract the
space between the two upper retorts and the crown
of the arch of the oven.</p>

<p>R. R. fig. 1, and 2, <a href="#PlateIV">plate IV.</a> and fig. 1, <a href="#PlateV">plate V.</a>
are cylindrical retorts, placed horizontally in
the oven, the lower series are either supported by a
large fire-brick, placed edgeways underneath the
retort, or by means of a stout wrought-iron
pillar, as shown in the design. The two upper
retorts are supported by wrought iron straps, T, T,<span class="pagenum" id="Page71">[71]</span>
T, fig. 1, and T, fig. 2, <a href="#PlateIV">plate IV.</a> The straps pass
through the brick-work of the upper part of the
oven, as shown in the designs, and they are
secured with screws and nuts to an iron bearing
bar, the extremities of which are supported by
the outer walls of the oven. Each retort is
furnished at the extremity opposite to the mouth-piece,
with a short projecting piece or tail let
into the brick-work of the oven, as seen in the
design, fig. 2, <a href="#PlateIV">plate IV.</a></p>

<p>M. Fig. 2, <a href="#PlateIV">plate IV.</a> shows the mouth-piece of
the retort with its cross bar and hand-screw; and fig.
6, <a href="#PlateV">plate V.</a> shows the mouth-piece drawn to a larger
scale. E. is the hand-screw, with its cross or
bearing bar D, which passes through the projecting
arms C. C. The lid of the mouth-piece has a
conical edge, so that it fits close when pushed into
its place by means of the hand-screw E. Fig. 7,
<a href="#PlateV">plate V.</a> is the lid which closes the mouth-piece;
the handscrew E, fig. 6, presses the lid close, to
render it air-tight, a thin stratum of loom luting
being first applied to the orifice of the mouth-piece.</p>

<p>F. fig. 2, <a href="#PlateIV">plate IV.</a>, is the fire-place, with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page72">[72]</span>
ash-pit E of the oven. The door of the ash-pit is
provided with three slits covered within by a register
slide, to regulate the admission of air as occasion
may require.</p>

<p>The fire passes freely and uniformly round all
the retorts, and the whole cavity of the oven acquires
an equable temperature, which it retains,
if the workman takes care to admit as little air as
possible, through the register door of the ash pit,
when the upper part of the arch, or crown of the
oven has acquired a bright cherry red heat.</p>

<p>We have stated already that in front of the oven,
is a platform, as represented in the sketch, fig. 2,
<a href="#PlateIV">plate IV.</a> In the floor of this platform, and directly
underneath the mouth-piece of the retorts, all of
which project beyond the brick-work of the oven,
is an opening covered with an iron trap door;
through this door the red hot coke, discharged
from the retorts, is suffered to fall below the stage
or platform into a cellar, or other fire-proof place,
that it may not annoy the workmen. O, O, fig. 1,
<a href="#PlateV">plate V.</a> denotes this opening through which the
coke falls.</p>

<p>P, fig. 2, <a href="#PlateIV">plate IV.</a>, and P. P. fig. 1, <a href="#PlateV">plate V.</a>
is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page73">[73]</span>
pipe proceeding perpendicularly from the upper
part of the mouth-piece of each retort, the other
extremity of which descends into the horizontal
hydraulic main H, which is shown in fig. 2, <a href="#PlateIV">plate
IV.</a> and <a href="#PlateV">plate V.</a>, supported upon iron columns.
This pipe serves to convey away the liquid and
gaseous products which become disengaged from
the coal in the retort during the distillatory process.</p>

<p>The liquid substances, namely the tar and ammoniacal
fluid, collect in the hydraulic main H, <a href="#PlateIV">plate
IV.</a> and <a href="#PlateV">V.</a>, which is furnished with a perpendicular
diaphragm or partition plate to cause a certain
quantity of the liquid deposited in it to accumulate
to a certain height, and thus to seal the perpendicular
pipe P. The liquid cannot flow out of the
horizontal pipe H, till it rises to the level of the
diaphragm. This arrangement is distinctly shewn
at H. fig. 2, <a href="#PlateIV">plate IV.</a>, where the diaphragm or partition
plate is seen in the section of the hydraulic
main, together with the extremity of the perpendicular
pipe P., descending into the fluid contained
in the hydraulic main.</p>

<p>K, Fig. 1, <a href="#PlateV">plate V.</a> is the discharging pipe, connected<span class="pagenum" id="Page74">[74]</span>
with the upper part of the horizontal main
H: it serves to convey away the gaseous and liquid
products from the hydraulic main H. By means
of this pipe the tar and ammoniacal fluids are
conveyed into any convenient reservoir, called the
tar cistern, which is perfectly air-tight, and from
this vessel the liquid may be drawn of by means
of a pipe or stop-cock. The extremity of the pipe
which communicates with the liquid, is bent downwards,
so that no air can enter the vessel: this arrangement
is shown at fig. 3, <a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a></p>

<p>It is essential that the condensation of the vaporous
fluids should be fully completed before they
reach the tar cistern. To effect this, there is
usually allowed a considerable distance to intervene
between the discharging pipe K, fig. 1, <a href="#PlateV">plate V.</a>, and
the reservoir destined to receive the condensible
products; or the pipe is made to pass through a
vessel containing water, called the condenser, which
acts in a similar manner as the refrigeratory of a
common still. It is obvious that it is immaterial how
the condensation of the vaporous fluid is effected;
it is essential, however, that the condensation
should be complete before the liquid tar and ammoniacal<span class="pagenum" id="Page75">[75]</span>
fluid reach the reservoir destined to
receive these products.</p>

<p>The gaseous fluid which accompanies the condensible
products, are then made to pass into the
lime machine, of which we shall speak hereafter,
in order to be deprived by means of quick-lime
and water, from the portion of sulphuretted hydrogen
and carbonic acid gas which was combined with
the gas. And when this has been accomplished,
the purified gas is conveyed into the gas-holder,
where it is stored up for use. This part of the
operation will be rendered more obvious hereafter.
In some establishments, the hydraulic main is
furnished with two discharging pipes, the one
carries away the condensible fluid, into which the
perpendicular pipes P, fig. 2, <a href="#PlateIV">plate IV.</a> dip, whilst
the other serves to convey away the gaseous fluids
to a condensor, in order to deposit the vaporous
portion of condensible liquid it may contain, and
from thence the gas passes into the purifying apparatus,
or lime machine. X, fig. 2, <a href="#PlateIV">plate IV.</a>, is
a small screw plug, which, when opened, restores
the equilibrium of the air within and without the
retort previous to the lid being taken off, to prevent<span class="pagenum" id="Page76">[76]</span>
the loud report, which otherwise happens
when the lid or cover of the retort is suddenly removed.
To avoid these explosive reports which
had become a nuisance to the neighbourhood of gas
works, the practice of gradually withdrawing the
lid of the retort, and at the same time presenting
a lighted torch has been adopted at some works,
which fully remedies the evil.</p>

<p>The number of retort ovens at the Westminster
Chartered Gas Works’ Stations, amounts to four
hundred and ninety.</p>

<h3><i>Difference in the quantity of Gas evolved during
different periods of the distillatory process,
and economical considerations resulting therefrom
in the manufacture of Coal Gas.</i></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="largecap">I</span>n conducting the decomposition of coal, the
evolution of the gas is far from being, with regard
to quantity, uniform during different periods of
the distillatory process. The formation of the gas
is more rapid in the beginning of the process, and
gradually slackens as the operation proceeds. The
gas also differs in its chemical constitution,
at different periods of the process; although
in the case of large supplies, this difference is of
little consequence after the gas is purified in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page78">[78]</span>
usual manner. The former consideration, however,
has given rise to various modes of operating, of
which it will be proper to take some notice.</p>

<p>It must be obvious, that in proportion as the
mass of coal in the retort becomes carbonized or
converted into coke, the exterior surface becomes
a gradually increasing obstacle to the action of
the heat upon the interior or central part of
the coal remaining to be decomposed. The heat
required on that account must be more intense,
and kept up to no purpose, and the extrication
of gas becomes slower and slower, as the operation
proceeds.</p>

<p>The loss occasioned by this rapid diminution of the
means employed, is serious in every point of view,
in regard as well to the quantity of fuel used and
time wasted, but it is unavoidable in the operation
of decomposing coal in masses or layers from
5 to 10 inches in thickness, and must be a great
drawback on the value of the gas-light discovery.</p>

<p>The loss of fuel, it is obvious, must be just in
proportion to the quantity of carbonised matter, or
coke, which is kept hot to no purpose, awaiting
the decomposition of that portion of coal, which it<span class="pagenum" id="Page79">[79]</span>
is the very means of protecting from becoming
decomposed.</p>

<p>A striking exemplification of this statement
will be seen in the following table, exhibiting
the result of the progressive produce of coal
gas, obtainable, in a given time, by means of cylindrical
and parallelopipedal retorts.</p>

<p>The same heat as we have seen from the preceding
table, <a href="#Page79">p. 79</a>, which is necessary during the first
hour of the operation, for the evolution of one
hundred and fifteen cubic feet of gas, is required
in the eighth hour for the production of no more
than forty-two cubic feet, being a decrease in effect
of nearly two-thirds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page82">[82]</span></p>

<p>When larger retorts are employed for decomposing
coal in masses, from five to ten inches in thickness,
the loss of heat is in a much greater ratio.</p>

<p>In the hope of remedying in some measure the
evils thus distinctly ascertained to arise from the
undue thickness of the masses of coal subjected to
the distillatory process, there have not been wanting
manufacturers who have had recourse to experiments
on a large scale, to ascertain with certainty
whether they might not be gainers by suffering the
distillatory process, when the retorts are charged
with two bushels of coal, to proceed only for the
space of six hours, instead of eight. But the result
of these experiments, as will be presently explained,
has shown satisfactorily that it is more profitable
to keep up the distillatory process for a period of
eight hours, with the retorts fully charged, than to
abridge the operation by terminating it at the end
of six hours.</p>

<p>Others again, have imagined, that it would be
more economical to decompose a less quantity of
coal at once, or to decrease the thickness of the
stratum of coal in the cylindrical, or in any of the
before named retorts; but then again, serious difficulties<span class="pagenum" id="Page83">[83]</span>
occur in the practice. The more frequent
charging of the retorts and luting on the covers,<a id="FNanchor16"></a><a href="#Footnote16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
which such a mode of operating require, occasions
a prodigious waste of fuel, time and labour. A
greater number of retorts and more workmen must
likewise be employed, in order to produce the requisite
quantity of gas daily, which the manufacturer
is called upon to supply; more space of ground is
required, and more dead capital must be sunk in the
establishment. The more frequent and sudden
alterations of temperature which the retorts necessarily
suffer, by the more frequent introduction of
cold coal, renders them extremely liable to become
injured; and it is almost impossible to maintain
a number of retorts thus worked, at an uniform
temperature.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote16"></a><a href="#FNanchor16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a>
When the cover is ground on, air-tight, the cost of the retort is
much increased.</p>

it may, an advantage will always be gained in
this mode of manufacturing coal gas, by working
the retorts at eight hours charges, as the workmen

<p>From a series of operations made<a id="FNanchor22"></a><a href="#Footnote22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> with twenty
parallelopipedal and with twenty cylindrical retorts,
worked for one month, it has been ascertained that
the decomposition of coal is most economically
conducted when each retort is charged with 100
pounds of coal, and the distillatory process be
continued for eight hours. Two men, one by day
and one by night, can attend nine or ten retorts.</p>

<h3><i>Temperature best adapted for working Cylindrical
Retorts.</i></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="largecap">T</span>here is perhaps no subject in the art of manufacturing
coal gas, on which practical men are less
agreed, than they are on the temperature most
economically to be employed for the production of
coal gas in the large way. It must be sufficiently
evident, that cast-iron retorts, when worked at a
low temperature, will last longer, than when exposed
to higher degrees of heat.<a id="FNanchor23"></a><a href="#Footnote23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Hence, according
to some operators, the economy of the process
consists in saving the retorts, at the expense of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page95">[95]</span>
diminution, even though considerable, in the quantity
of gas obtained; whilst, according to others,
it is more economical to obtain the largest possible
quantity of gas at the expence of any consequent
injury to the distillatory vessel.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote23"></a><a href="#FNanchor23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a>
It is essential that the retorts should be kept in constant action
night and day, or at least never allowed to go below a red heat. The
first portion of oxide which forms upon the surface, when allowed to
cool, cracks and falls off, leaving a new surface to be acted upon the
next time it is heated. By thus being every day heated and cooled, a
retort will be speedily destroyed.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The truth appears to be wholly with neither of
these extremes, nor indeed in any absolute general
rule which can be ventured on the subject.</p>

<p>The degree of temperature proper to be adopted
in gas works, where the method of decomposing
coal in masses, or layers from four to eight inches in
thickness, and upwards, is practised by means of the
cast-iron retorts, of which a description has been
given, <a href="#Page53">p. 53</a>, chiefly depends on circumstances of a
local nature, with regard to the price of coal and labour,
so that where in one place it may be more profitable
to employ a very high temperature for the
production of the gas, it may be in others quite the
reverse.</p>

<p>The utmost therefore that can be done on this
head, is to state what these circumstances are, and
to shew the value which belongs to them under
every supposable situation.</p>

<p>In this metropolis, and in all other places where
coal and labour bear a higher price than probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page96">[96]</span>
elsewhere in this country, and where saving of time
is also an object of primary importance, it is clearly
established, that the manufacturer who pursues the
method of decomposing coal in masses from five to
eight inches and upwards in thickness, by means
of cast-iron retorts,<a id="FNanchor24"></a><a href="#Footnote24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> will consult his interest best,
by employing such a high temperature for the
decomposition of the coal, as will produce in the
shortest time the greatest possible quantity of gas,
from a given quantity of coal, without regarding
the unavoidable deterioration of the retorts. But
in places where coal and labour is cheap, it will be
his interest to save the retorts at the expence of
the coal. But that this fact may not rest on
mere general assertion, I shall subjoin for the
satisfaction of the reader a few statements of experiments
made upon a large scale for the purpose
of ascertaining these facts.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote24"></a><a href="#FNanchor24"><span class="label">[24]</span></a>
The Retorts should be manufactured of what is called in commerce,
<i>iron of the second process</i>. The best cast-iron of this kind, is
of a light grey colour, its fracture is granulated and dull, it receives a
dent from the blow of a hammer. The cast-iron which exhibits a dark
grey or black colour inclining to blue, and presents granular concretions,
readily friable, and therefore unfit for vessels intended to stand
a long continued heat.</p>

<h3><i>Annual Creditor and Debtor Account of
manufacturing daily from 50,000 to 102,000
cubic feet of gas at the price which coal
bears in the metropolis.&mdash;The operation being
commenced with new Retorts, and the retorts
being left in a fit working state.</i></h3>

<p>The first of the following processes was conducted
on the principle that coal and labour, being of an
high price, as in London, it is most economical to
obtain the greatest possible quantity of gas from a
given quantity of coal in the least possible time,
without any regard to the injury done to the distillatory
vessel.</p>

<p>The second process is intended to illustrate the
correctness of that principle, by shewing that where
coal and labour are at the high prices stated in the
first process, it is a losing system to work the
retorts at a lower temperature, in order to make
them last longer.</p>

<p>In some respects a similarity will be observed
between these experiments, and those already given<span class="pagenum" id="Page98">[98]</span>
in <a href="#Page85">page 85</a>, but besides their having reference to
the separate and distinct circumstance of the high
prices of coal and labour in London, it will be
found that they also differ from the former statements,
in exhibiting, not merely the expence of
working, but the original cost of erecting the retorts,
as well as the expence of replacing them.</p>

<h4><i>Process I.</i></h4>

<p>The quantity of gas to be supplied each night,
was 50,000 cubic feet.</p>

<p>In order to produce this quantity, thirty cylindrical
retorts, each containing two bushels of Newcastle
coal, were put in action. The temperature
at which the retorts were worked, was a bright
cherry redness, at which they produced at the rate
of ten thousand cubic feet of gas, from a chaldron
of Newcastle coal.</p>

<p>To work the retorts, three workmen by day and
three by night, were required.</p>

<p>The retorts were charged three times every
twenty-four hours. The first total expence of
erecting the retorts, was £. 23 each, and it was
found, that when worked night and day, they could<span class="pagenum" id="Page99">[99]</span>
not, with the utmost care, be made to continue fit
for use for more than from five to six months;
hence, a double set of the original number of
retorts was requisite each year.</p>

stood as follows:</p>

<h4><i>Process II.</i></h4>

<p>The next experiment made was, to ascertain the
contrary practice of operating, namely the mode of
working the retorts, on the principle which holds
out, that it is more economical to be satisfied with
a less quantity of gas than what the coal is capable<span class="pagenum" id="Page101">[101]</span>
of furnishing, because by so doing the retorts
become less deteriorated and remain for a longer
time in a state fit for use.</p>

<p>The quantity of gas to be supplied each night,
was, as in the preceding process, fifty thousand
cubic feet.</p>

<p>The number of retorts required to produce that
quantity, was forty-two, and to make them last
twelve months instead of six months, as in the
preceding process, it was necessary to work them
at a temperature, at which a chaldron of coal

<p>The reader will have no difficulty in calculating
from the preceding experiments, every variation
which can possibly take place, as to the degree of<span class="pagenum" id="Page106">[106]</span>
temperature most economically to be employed in
consequence of a variation in the prices of coal, coke
and labour.<a id="FNanchor27"></a><a href="#Footnote27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote27"></a><a href="#FNanchor27"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> The average cost at which coal gas can be manufactured on a
large scale in London, is seven shillings the thousand cubic feet,
deducting not only the interest of the capital sunk in erecting the
establishment, rent and taxes, the cost of the coal, labour, wear and
tear of the machinery, and superintendence, but all other necessary
and incidental expences that may occur.</p>

<h3><i>Comparative facility with which the decomposition
of different species of Coal is effected.</i></h3>

<p>The temperature necessary for the decomposition
of different kinds of coal, varies. Some species of
coal are more readily decomposed, and require a
less portion of fuel than others; they yield up their
maximum quantity of gas, in an almost equal stream
from beginning to end, and no extraordinary increase
of temperature is required to terminate the
distillatory process. Other kinds of coal require a
different treatment; the temperature necessary to<span class="pagenum" id="Page107">[107]</span>
complete their decomposition requires that the
heat should be considerably increased as the process
advances; and without this condition the evolution
of the gas would cease altogether.</p>

<p>A striking proof of this statement may be seen
when Newcastle or Sunderland coal are attempted
to be decomposed at a temperature which is sufficient
for the decomposition of Scotch Splent coal,
or Lancashire Wiggan coal.</p>

<p>The decomposition of the latter, will be fully
effected when the distillatory vessel exhibits to the
eye a dull cherry redness, and the evolution of the
gas at such a temperature will take place in torrents
from beginning to end. In order, on the other
hand, to complete the decomposition of Newcastle
and Sunderland coal, the heat must be increased
as the process proceeds, and the production of the
gas will be extended far beyond the time required
for decomposing a like quantity of Scotch, or Lancashire
Wiggan coal, when exposed to the same
degree of heat.</p>

<p>It must be allowed, however, that few experiments
have been yet made on this subject. I have reason<span class="pagenum" id="Page108">[108]</span>
to believe that all those varieties of coal which
afford an incoherent friable coke, are decomposed at
a much lower degree of heat, than such as produce,
when treated under like circumstances, a ponderous
compact coke. And if we give credit to the assertion
of those workmen, whose business it is to
manufacture a given quantity of gas by means of a
certain quantity of coal delivered to them, it would
appear that coal which affords gas abounding in
sulphuretted hydrogen, is the kind of coal most
easily to be decomposed. This, as far as it regards
the decomposition of Scotch Splent or cannel coal,
is certainly true. No species of coal affords gas at
a lower temperature, and of none is the gaseous
product more loaded with sulphuretted hydrogen
gas. The subject is important and deserves to be
pursued; particularly in places where coke is not,
as it is in the metropolis, and all places where coal
bears a high price, next to gas, the primary article
to which the attention of the manufacturer of coal
gas ought to be directed.</p>

<p>The following are the result of a series of experiments
on the subject made at the Westminster<span class="pagenum" id="Page109">[109]</span>
Gas Works,<a id="FNanchor28"></a><a href="#Footnote28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> the same temperature being employed

<h3><i>Horizontal Rotary Retorts, lately brought into
use for manufacturing coal gas.</i></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="largecap">T</span>he many disadvantages attendant on the plan
of decomposing coal in masses from five to ten
inches in thickness, as already sufficiently exposed
in the preceding parts, had naturally the effect of
developing a principle of manufacturing coal gas,
which practice has now fully established, namely:
that to decompose coal, in thin layers from two to
four inches in thickness, is to obtain the greatest
quantity of gas from a given quantity of coal at the
least expence.</p>

<p>Mr. Clegg was the first person who pointed out to
the public the advantages that must accrue from this
mode of operating, and to him we are indebted for<span class="pagenum" id="Page111">[111]</span>
the construction of an apparatus, the great ingenuity
and superiority of which, entitles what is
called the horizontal rotary retort, to all the merit
and praise that belongs to the character of an
original invention.</p>

<p>The numerous and great advantages of this distillatory
apparatus, the rapidly increasing adoption of
it,<a id="FNanchor29"></a><a href="#Footnote29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and the almost certain prospect which exists of
their ultimately superseding all former methods of
decomposing coal, make it proper that I should lay
before the reader, as full an account as my limits
will permit, of the construction and operation of
this retort, and the mode of applying it; and this
becomes the more necessary on account of the many
important improvements which the apparatus has
undergone since its first adoption,<a id="FNanchor30"></a><a href="#Footnote30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and of which
no description has yet been laid before the public.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote29"></a><a href="#FNanchor29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> Retorts of this description have been lately adopted, in the Gas
Works at Bristol, Birmingham, Chester, Kidderminster, and at many
other provincial Gas Establishments.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote30"></a><a href="#FNanchor30"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> An account of the original construction of the rotary retort may
be seen in the Repository of Arts, No. CLXXVI, 1816, page I. and
also in the Journal of Science, Vol. II. page 133.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page112">[112]</span></p>

<p>The following account will render the construction
of this retort sufficiently obvious:</p>

<h3><i>Description of the Horizontal Rotary Retorts
at the Royal Mint.</i><a id="FNanchor31"></a><a href="#Footnote31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote31"></a><a href="#FNanchor31"><span class="label">[31]</span></a>  The retorts lately erected at the Gas Works, at Birmingham,
Chester, Bristol, &amp;c. are similar to those at the mint.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The horizontal rotary Retorts at the Royal Mint,
are hollow cylinders, eight feet six inches in diameter
and 15 inches high, arched a little at the top. They
are made of wrought-iron plates, half an inch thick,
rivetted together in the manner of a steam-engine
boiler; A, A, A, fig. 2, <a href="#PlateIII">plate III.</a> exhibits a perpendicular
section of the rotary retort. In fig. 1, <a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a>
the retort is seen fixed in the brick-work; <i>a</i>, fig. 1,
<a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a> shews the mouth of the retort, through
which the coals are introduced, and from whence
the coke is withdrawn. It is also shown in perspective
at B, B, B. fig. 2. <a href="#PlateVII">plate VII.</a> The mouth
is closed with a cast-iron door fitted on air-tight by
grinding.</p>

<p>The door is connected at its upper and lower
extremities, with a frame and adjusting rod, see
B, B, fig. 1, <a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a>, and also <a href="#PlateVII">plate VII.</a>, by means
of which it may readily be slided down below the<span class="pagenum" id="Page113">[113]</span>
mouth of the retort, when the coals are to be introduced,
or coke is to be withdrawn. To the upper
extremity of the rod B, fig. 1, <a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a>, is fixed a
lever, loaded with a counterpoise weight C, to
balance the door, and to render the opening and
closing of it easy and expeditious.</p>

<p>The mouth-piece and its door is three feet
long, and nine inches wide; it projects nine
inches beyond the brick-work or furnace in which
the retort is fixed, as may be seen at fig. 1, <a href="#PlateII">plate
II.</a></p>

<p>The fire-place, which is on the opposite side to
that of the mouth of the retort, heats only one-third
part of the whole capacity of the retort to that degree
which is proper for the complete and rapid
decomposition of the coal, while the remaining
parts, which are not over the fire-place, and to
which the fire flues do not extend, are kept at a
lower temperature.</p>

<p>The flues are directed under about one-third of
the area of the bottom of the retort, and after having
passed over one-third part of the area of the top of
the retort, they pass into the chimney. Fig. 1, <a href="#PlateVI">plate
VI.</a>, exhibits the direction of the flues; A, A, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page114">[114]</span>
flues, and the fire-place. The whole retort is
guarded from the contact of the fire, which would
soon destroy it, by fire-bricks; it notwithstanding
speedily receives the full effect of the heat, and
retains its temperature when once heated for a long
time. Fig. 1, <a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a>, exhibits one of the retorts
fixed in its furnace. A perspective view of three
retorts may be seen in fig. 2, <a href="#PlateVII">plate VII.</a></p>

<p>Through the centre of the retort, passes perpendicularly,
an iron shaft D, as shown in the section
of the retort, fig. 2, <a href="#PlateIII">plate III.</a>, and also in fig. 1,
<a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a> The lower extremity of the shaft revolves
upon the bottom of the retort, in a cup-shaped
cavity, while its upper extremity passes through the
roof of the retort, where the latter is made air-tight
by means of a pipe E, fig. 1, <a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a>, and E,
fig. 2, <a href="#PlateIII">plate III.</a>, closed at the top and surrounding
the shaft, and hence the shaft must always preserve
its centre.</p>

<p>To the lower extremity of the shaft is keyed
a box or centre piece, (technically called a rose
centre,) F, fig. 2, <a href="#PlateIII">plate III.</a> It is also seen in the
perpendicular section of the retort, fig. 1, <a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a>
From this shaft radiate twelve wrought-iron arms,<span class="pagenum" id="Page115">[115]</span>
G, G, fig. 2, <a href="#PlateIII">plate III.</a>,<a id="FNanchor32"></a><a href="#Footnote32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> fixed in sockets made in
the box. These arms are elevated three inches
above the bottom of the retort, and extend to nearly
within its whole inner circumference. They are
wedge-shaped, and their greatest diameter is at right
angles to the base of the retort, so that the weight
of the arms rests on the axis. They are intersected
by two concentric rings, as will be seen on
inspecting fig. 5, <a href="#PlateIII">plate III.</a>, which exhibits the plan
of the retort, together with the iron arms, G, G,
and concentric rings. The centre of figure 5,
shows also the plan of the rose centre F, fig. 2,
<a href="#PlateIII">plate III.</a>, into which the arms are keyed.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote32"></a><a href="#FNanchor32"><span class="label">[32]</span></a> In the horizontal rotary Retorts at the Chester, Birmingham and
Bristol Gas Works, which are twelve feet six inches in diameter, there
are fifteen arms. At some Gas Works the arms are made of cast-iron.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Between the arms are placed twelve shallow iron
trays or boxes, destined to contain the coal from
which the gas is to be obtained. They are formed
to the segment of a circle, hence the whole series of
them when arranged in the retort, exhibits a shallow
circular tray, which, when motion is given to
the shaft, may be made to revolve within the retort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page116">[116]</span></p>

<p>Fig. 12, <a href="#PlateIII">plate III.</a> exhibits one of the shallow
trays, or coal boxes in perspective.</p>

<p>It will be obvious, that by the motion of the
shaft, any number of the trays or coal-boxes can
readily be brought from the coldest, into the hottest,
and from the hottest into the coldest part of the
retort.</p>

<p>H, fig. 1, <a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a>, and <i>a</i>, <a href="#PlateIII">plate III.</a>, or H, <a href="#PlateVII">plate
VII.</a>, is a perpendicular pipe situated at the margin of
the retort, close behind the mouth-piece, and consequently
in the coldest part of the retort. It serves
to carry off the distillatory products evolved from
the coal, and causes part of the vaporous tar, which
becomes condensed in it, to trickle back again
upon the coal in the retort, in order to become
converted into gas, when the coal on which it falls
becomes situated over the fire-place.</p>

<p>This pipe is furnished at its upper extremity with
a <i>hydraulic valve</i>, J, fig. 1, <a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a> It consists
simply of an inverted cup X, applied over the
upper open extremity of the perpendicular pipe
H, and submersed into a cup formed of a portion
of larger pipe, surrounding the pipe H, containing
tar. The smaller, or inner cup X, is represented<span class="pagenum" id="Page117">[117]</span>
in the design raised out of the liquid contained
in the outer cup J, to show an aperture Y,
made in the smaller or inner cup; the use of which
will be mentioned hereafter. The inverted cup
X, is furnished with a chain, one extremity of
which is fastened to the upper extremity of the cup,
the other passes over a small wheel, and descends
through the roof of the building, as shown in the
design.</p>

<p>K, fig. 1, <a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a>, or K K, fig. 2, <a href="#PlateVII">plate VII.</a>, is
a branch pipe proceeding laterally from the perpendicular
pipe H; it communicates with the
hydraulic box L, fig. 1, <a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a> N, is a pipe
which proceeds from the hydraulic box L; it
serves to carry away the gaseous and liquid
products to their places of destination. The liquid
products, namely, the tar and ammoniacal fluid,
become deposited in the tar cistern, fig. 3, <a href="#PlateII">plate
II.</a>, into which the pipe N terminates. The tar
cistern is furnished with two floats Y Y; the one
serves to indicate the quantity of tar, and the other
the quantity of aqueous ammoniacal fluid contained
in the vessel. These fluids may be drawn off<span class="pagenum" id="Page118">[118]</span>
without admitting air into the vessel by the stop-cock
and bent tube, exhibited in the figure.</p>

<p>The shorter pipe N, which proceeds from the tar
cistern, fig. 3, <a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a>, and communicates with the
purifying apparatus or lime machine, fig. 2, <a href="#PlateII">plate
II.</a>, serves to convey the gaseous fluid, which accompanied
the condensible liquids deposited in the
tar cistern, back again into the lime machine,
or purifying apparatus, fig. 2, <a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a>, the construction
of which, together with the conveyance
of the gas from this vessel to its place of destination
will be stated hereafter.</p>

<p>L, fig. 1, <a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a>, or fig. 2, <a href="#PlateVII">plate VII.</a>, is
an iron flap table, placed level with the bottom of
the mouth of the retort. It is convenient to hold
several coal trays ready charged with coal in a state
fit to be introduced into the retort.</p>

<p>The fire-place, flues, and ash-pit of the furnace,
in which the retort is fixed, are sufficiently obvious
by mere inspection of fig. 1, <a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a> The front
elevation of the retort is seen in fig. 2, <a href="#PlateVII">plate
VII.</a>, which exhibits three horizontal retorts; two
of which have the door of the mouth-piece slided<span class="pagenum" id="Page119">[119]</span>
down, and one with the door in its place, or shut.
The circular ring seen in this design, at the top of
each retort, which rests on iron-bearing bars, the
extremities of which are let into the end walls
of the furnace, serves to support the roof of the
retort by means of bolts, proceeding from the inner
side of the roof. This arrangement is likewise
shown in the section, fig. 1, <a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a><a id="FNanchor33"></a><a href="#Footnote33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> At the
bended part of the perpendicular pipe H, fig.
1, <a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a>, is seen a bonnet, or cover, which closes
an opening made into the pipe H, through which,
by means of an iron rod, the lower extremity of
the pipe H, may, from time to time, be examined,
to guard against an incrustation of decomposed tar
or carbonaceous matter that might happen to accumulate
in that part of the pipe. The upper part
of the pipe H, above the bonnet at the bended part,
requires no examination.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote33"></a><a href="#FNanchor33"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> A more economical method of supporting the roof of the retort
has lately been adopted by Mr. Clegg. It consists in giving the roof
the form of an inverted arch, supported on the Catenaria plan, by
two bolts only, placed at the most elevated extremity of the arch and
secured to an horizontal beam.</p>

support the cross bar <i>e</i>; it is also seen at <i>e</i>, in the
plan of the retort, fig. 5, <a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a> In this figure
<i>b</i> is the flanch of the retort, and <i>c</i> the door.</p>

<p>These few particulars will be sufficient to enable
the reader to understand the construction of the
retort; its action is as follows.</p>

<h3><i>Action and Management of the Horizontal
Rotary Retort.</i></h3>

<p>When the retort is heated to the proper temperature
for the decomposition of the coal, the door
is slided down, and the coal boxes charged with
small coal are slided into the retort from the table,
L, fig. 1, <a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a>, one by one, so that each box
rests firmly upon the concentric rings placed between
the arms of the retort; the door is then
slided up again into its place and rendered air-tight
by means of wedges.</p>

<p>When the whole circle fig. 5, <a href="#PlateIII">plate III.</a> is thus filled<span class="pagenum" id="Page121">[121]</span>
with coal-boxes, (the coal should be spread in
the boxes, in layers two or three inches in depth,)
it is obvious that of all the twelve boxes, four only
can be situated directly over the fire-place, while
the remaining eight are placed right and left towards
the door of the retort. The coal in the
former boxes receives the full effect of the heat,
(see the plan of the fire flues of the retort, fig. 1,
<a href="#PlateVI">plate VI.</a>,) while the remaining eight boxes to which
the fire does not extend, are less heated. The coal
in the four boxes which are in the hottest part of
the retort becomes rapidly decomposed, whilst the
coal in all the other boxes is gradually heated,
and consequently deprived only of moisture, previous
to being subjected to the greatest heat. The
box which is situated under the condensing pipe
H, <a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a>, near the entry door, receives the
condensed tar which trickles down the pipe H.</p>

<p>Now let us suppose that the coal in the four
boxes over the fire place is fully decomposed, which
will be the case if 32<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> pounds of coal are in each
box, in two hours, the workman then turns the
shaft E, fig. 1, <a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a>, one-third part of the circumference<span class="pagenum" id="Page122">[122]</span>
of a circle, by pulling towards him by
means of an iron hook the nearest iron arm that may
happen to be opposite to the door; this moves those
boxes which at the commencement of the operation
were over the fire-place, towards the coldest
part of the retort, namely, towards the door
which is opposite to the fire-place, and a second
series, or four of the adjacent boxes, are brought in
turn into the hottest part of the retort, or over the
fire-place, from whence the preceding boxes were
removed.</p>

<p>When the coal in the second series of boxes has
been two hours in the hottest part of the retort, its
decomposition will be completed; the workman
therefore turns the shaft again one-third part of
a circle, and a third series advances in their place,
while at the same time the first series becomes
situated opposite the entry door of the retort, from
whence they may be withdrawn and exchanged
for an extra set of trays, ready charged with coal
and placed on the iron table for that purpose.</p>

<p>In this manner the operation proceeds. One-third
part of the whole charge of coal within the retort is<span class="pagenum" id="Page123">[123]</span>
always in the act of becoming decomposed; another
third part is gradually heated, and totally deprived
of moisture, previous to its being exposed to the
temperature necessary for its decomposition; and
the remaining third part placed in the coldest part
of the retort, receives that portion of tar, which
escapes decomposition, and trickles down the perpendicular
pipe, in order to be decomposed when
the coal upon which it falls becomes situated over
the fire-place. Hence the quantity of tar obtained
from one chaldron of Newcastle coal, when decomposed
by means of an horizontal rotary retort, seldom
amounts to more than sixty or seventy pounds,
whereas the same quantity of coal when decomposed
by means of cylindrical or parallelopipedal retorts,
yields never less than from one hundred and fifty, to
one hundred and eighty pounds. An horizontal
rotary retort, twelve feet six inches in diameter, and
fifteen inches high, furnishes in the ordinary way of
working every twenty-four hours, fifteen thousand
cubic feet of gas, when five trays of the retort
are charged with three bushels of Newcastle coal.
The weight of the retort is three tons; its capacity,
one hundred and fifty cubic feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page124">[124]</span></p>

<p>The hydraulic valve described <a href="#Page116">page 116</a>, serves
merely to restore the equilibrium, between the
gas within the retort, and the atmospheric air
without, previous to the opening of the door of the
mouth of the retort. To effect this the workman
raises the cup X, by means of the chain, so that the
small hole Y, in the cup X, becomes raised out of
the tar in the cup L, and he closes it again when
the retort is charged: this operation requires
two minutes. We have stated already, that the door
of the retort is ground air-tight, and hence it
requires no luting.</p>

<h3><i>Advantages of the method of manufacturing
Coal Gas by means of Horizontal Rotary
Retorts.</i></h3>

<p>The advantages of the mode of manufacturing
coal gas by means of horizontal rotary retorts, consist
in a saving of fuel, time, labour, and machinery,
a gain in the quantity of gas, and increase
in the quantity of coke.</p>

<p><i>Saving of fuel.</i>&mdash;The mass of coal subjected to
decomposition being reduced from the dimension<span class="pagenum" id="Page125">[125]</span>
required in the old plan (by means of cylindrical
retorts) to the narrowest available limits, there
being no outward crust of coke to be kept red hot
for hours to no purpose, while the decomposition
of the interior mass of coal is going on;&mdash;the coke
itself being as soon as formed removed from the
source of heat, and applied while cooling, to warm
up a fresh supply of coal next in order of becoming
decomposed, instead of being discharged in a red
hot state, into the open air, as requires to be done
in the practice before detailed&mdash;the whole fuel in
short being necessarily and beneficially expended&mdash;the
saving of coal employed as fuel in this respect,
is exactly the gaining of all that is lost on the plan
of employing cylindrical or any of the retorts before
described. Hence one chaldron of coal is
decomposed at the gas establishments where horizontal
rotary retorts are in action by means of
twenty per cent of fuel, and at some establishments
an expert stoker will work the retorts
with fifteen per cent of fuel.</p>

<p><i>Saving of time.</i>&mdash;The saving of time does not
merely amount to what is consequent on the speedier
decomposition of the coal, and the saving of<span class="pagenum" id="Page126">[126]</span>
that heat which formerly required to be kept up a
length of time to no adequate purpose; it also includes
all that is gained in consequence of the
revolving motion to which the coal is submitted,
superseding, as has been already mentioned, the necessity
of discharging the coke in an ignited state
from the retort.</p>

<p>When the coke is removed, as previously explained,
<a href="#Page72">page 72</a>, red hot from the cylindrical,
parallelopipedal, semi-cylindrical or ellipsoidal retorts,
the charging of the distillatory vessel with
fresh coal produces such a sudden reduction of
temperature, that from three to four hours inevitably
elapse before the retort is again in a full working
state, and to this circumstance the workmen (perhaps
very justly) attribute the frequent sudden
injury which the distillatory cast-iron vessel sustains.</p>

<p>Another striking advantage of the new mode of
decomposing coal is, that besides saving the time
which is wasted in keeping up an intense temperature
unnecessarily the revolving apparatus prevents
entirely the loss occasioned by these three or
four hours of unnecessary cooling of the distillatory<span class="pagenum" id="Page127">[127]</span>
vessel. For each series of trays, or coal boxes,
containing the ignited coke, of the horizontal
rotary retort, being suffered to cool within the
retort before the coke is discharged, and being
placed in contact with a fresh supply of coal, the
temperature of the retort is kept up uniformly the
same from beginning to end.</p>

<p><i>Saving of Labour.</i>&mdash;In consequence of the
superior facility with which the mode of decomposing
coal in thin layers and removing the coke
as fast as it is formed is effected, the saving in
point of labour is very great. The charging and
discharging of the retort is performed in two minutes.
Hence one chaldron of coal may be decomposed by
means of three horizontal rotary retorts, each
twelve feet six inches in diameter, and with the
attendance of two men, in eight hours, and produces
from fifteen thousand, to eighteen thousand cubic
feet of gas, whilst ten thousand cubic feet of gas
can only be obtained from the same quantity of coal
in eight hours, by means of twenty cylindrical
retorts, attended by the same number of workmen.</p>

<p><i>Saving of machinery.</i>&mdash;When we compare the
original cost and wear and tear of the horizontal<span class="pagenum" id="Page128">[128]</span>
rotary retorts, with the cost and deterioration of a set
of cylindrical, parallelopipedal, ellipsoidal, or semi-cylindrical
retorts of an equal power, (that is to say
to produce a like quantity of gas, in a given time,)
a difference not less striking presents itself in
favour of the horizontal retort.</p>

<p>We have stated already, that cylindrical, ellipsoidal,
parallelopipedal, or semi-cylindrical retorts,
when constantly kept in action, and worked to the
greatest advantage, cannot be made to last longer
than six months.<a id="FNanchor34"></a><a href="#Footnote34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote34"></a><a href="#FNanchor34"><span class="label">[34]</span></a> They are frequently rendered unfit for use in three months, and
at some works in two months, owing not less to the irregularity of
the temperature at which they are worked, than to the carelessness of
the workmen.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Only one-third part of the top and bottom plates
of the rotary retort being exposed to the action
of heat, are alone liable to deterioration. It is
only necessary therefore that these parts of the
vessel be renewed, while the other parts remain
uninjured for years. The new top and bottom
plates being rivetted to the old and undecayed
part, without deranging the rest, the retort is
rendered as good as new.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page129">[129]</span></p>

<p><i>Gain in the quantity of gas.</i>&mdash;A large increase
in the quantity of gas obtained, is a natural consequence
of the mode in which the decomposition of
coal is effected by means of the horizontal rotary
retort.</p>

<p>Every body knows that coal, when decomposed
slowly, affords a larger quantity of tar and ammoniacal
liquor, but a less quantity of gas than when
decomposed rapidly.</p>

<p>In the former case, the formation of the proximate
products which coal is capable of furnishing
is effected properly; the bituminous part of the
coal is developed under the most favourable circumstances.</p>

<p>But when coal, after being previously deprived
of moisture, is very suddenly heated to a high temperature,
in thin strata, and small portions at a time,
so that the vaporous products instead of becoming
condensed, are made to come into contact with a
substance (which in this case is the roof of the retort,)
kept constantly at a temperature rather higher
than that at which gold, silver, and copper melts,
(32°, Wedgwood, or 5237°, Fahrenheit,) a very
different arrangement of principles takes place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page130">[130]</span></p>

<p>The greatest portion of tar which the coal is
capable of furnishing, instead of being produced in
a liquid form, becomes then decomposed into carburetted
hydrogen, and olifiant gas. That portion
of tar which escapes decomposition, is condensed in
the perpendicular pipe <i>H</i>, fig. 2, <a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a>, or <i>H</i>,
fig. 2, <a href="#PlateVII">plate VII.</a>, and falls back again into the
retort, where it is also decomposed when the coal
upon which it falls comes under the process of
decomposition.</p>

<p>Hence the quantity of tar obtained by means of
horizontal rotary retorts, is very small; it seldom
exceeds the proportion mentioned <a href="#Page123">page 123</a>, when
the retort is worked to the greatest advantage. This
quantity is considerably diminished, when Newcastle
coal, broken into pieces of the size of split
pease is decomposed in strata, not exceeding two
inches in thickness. The quantity of tar afforded by
a chaldron of coal then amounts to thirty pounds,
whilst at the same time the quality of the gas
is improved; because coal tar furnishes olifiant
gas, which the coal alone, when distilled by
means of cylindrical or other shaped cast-iron
retorts of the usual form, cannot produce, or at<span class="pagenum" id="Page131">[131]</span>
least but in a small quantity. One gallon of coal tar
yields 15 cubic feet of olifiant gas, which greatly
increases the illuminating power of the carburetted
hydrogen.</p>

<p>From what has been so far stated, it will be
understood why one chaldron of Newcastle coal,
when decomposed by the new process, may
readily be made to produce from 15,000 to 18,000
cubic feet of gas and upwards, whereas the same
quantity of coal, if decomposed by the old method,
yields only upon an average 10,000 cubic feet of gas.<a id="FNanchor35"></a><a href="#Footnote35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote35"></a><a href="#FNanchor35"><span class="label">[35]</span></a> The experiments exhibiting the maximum quantity of gas
obtainable from coal, see <a href="#Page44">page 44</a>, were made with the horizontal
rotary retorts at the Royal Mint. Similar results have also been obtained
at the Westminster Gas-Works.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>In the former case, the greater part of the essential
oil and tar which the coal would have afforded
is decomposed, as stated already by virtue of the
high temperature to which the vapourous tar is
suddenly exposed in the horizontal rotary retort,
which is not the case when coal is decomposed in
the retorts of the old construction.</p>

<p><i>Gain in the quantity of coke.</i>&mdash;With the cylindrical
or cast-iron retorts of the old shapes, the quantity<span class="pagenum" id="Page132">[132]</span>
of coke obtained from a given quantity of coal
is upon an average 25 per cent. increase by
measure from the best kind of Newcastle and Sunderland
coal, but taking into account the waste
incurred in breaking out and removing the red hot
coke from the retort, which requires the application
of rakers and crow bars, a considerable
portion of it becomes reduced to dust or breeze,
and hence no more than bulk for bulk of the coal
decomposed can seldom be depended upon as the
ultimate saleable quantity of coke.<a id="FNanchor36"></a><a href="#Footnote36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote36"></a><a href="#FNanchor36"><span class="label">[36]</span></a> There is a vast difference with regard to the quality as well
as quantity of coke obtained from different kinds of coal. Some kinds
of coal produce a species of coke which is so friable that it will hardly
bear being moved from place to place without crumbling into dust,
others produce coke in pieces of the size of small pebbles, while a
third sort affords coke of a stony hardness.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>In the new mode of carbonizing coal by means
of the horizontal rotary retorts, the increase of coke
is 150 per cent. by measure, so that one chaldron of
Newcastle coal produces two and a half chaldron of
coke&mdash;this is the quantity produced upon an average.
But when the retort is worked at a temperature to<span class="pagenum" id="Page133">[133]</span>
produce at the rate of 18,000 cubic feet of gas from
the chaldron of coal, the increase of coke by measure
is 175 per cent.; in that case, the layers of coal in
the coal boxes must not exceed two inches in thickness,
so that the volume of coke is in the ratio of the
quantity of gas produced and the rapidity and
elevation of temperature at which the decomposition
of the coal is effected.</p>

<p>The coke being withdrawn from the place where
it is formed by merely turning the boxes containing
it, upside down, all waste is avoided.</p>

<p>With respect, again, to the quality of the coke, it
will be observed that when the coal is rapidly carbonized
in thin layers, and has full liberty to
expand freely, as in the case of the horizontal
rotary retort, it affords a light and porous coke,
whereas in the cylindrical, paralellopipedal, semi-cylindrical,
or ellipsoidal retorts, the coke being
compressed, the intense heat to which it is so long
and superfluously exposed, renders it extremely
dense, and of a stony hardness.</p>

<p>The latter sort of coke is unquestionably preferable
for the smelter, and all furnace operations,
standing the blast of the bellows well. But the coke<span class="pagenum" id="Page134">[134]</span>
produced in the new mode of operating, is better
suited for the great majority of domestic purposes,
kindling more readily, and making a more cheerful
fire. The combustion of the dense, or as it is now
called, cylinder coke, can be only kept up when
used in a common grate, by a strong draft of air,
and it is therefore not so well suited for fuel for
domestic purposes, to make a small fire; but the
coke obtained by the horizontal rotary retort,
readily maintains its own combustion, even when
in small masses; hence it may be used without
any trouble, either in the fire-place of the cottager,
or of the prince, and accordingly it bears a higher
price in the market.</p>

<h3><i>Directions to workmen, with regard to the management
of Horizontal Rotary Retorts.</i></h3>

<p>The circumstance most essential to the economical
application of the horizontal rotary retort, is, as has
been repeatedly stated, that the coal shall be spread
in thin layers in the boxes of the retort, not exceeding
from two to four inches in thickness; and
it may be laid down as a general rule, that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page135">[135]</span>
thinner the layers, and the higher the temperature,
the greater will be the proportion of gas, the greater
the bulk of coke, and the smaller the quantity of
tar.</p>

<p>The coal before it is submitted to the distillatory
process, should be as dry as possible, and the more
it is comminuted the better. The very refuse of the
coal called <i>slack</i>, provided it is perfectly free from
foreign matter, answers best. It should also be
spread in the trays, in even layers.</p>

<p>When the retort is in a good working state, the
temperature should be kept up by the application
of small quantities of fuel at a time. A prodigious
saving of fuel may be effected by attending the fire
properly, and it is this which distinguishes a careful
stoker from a bungler. For in the working of
this retort particularly, it is a wasteful process to
clog up the fire-place with a large quantity of fuel
injudiciously applied. The difference in this
respect, with regard to the economy of fuel is so
great, that an expert stoker will work the retort
with one-third less of fuel and half the labour
that would be employed by a negligent workman.</p>

<p>The quantity of gas produced from a chaldron of<span class="pagenum" id="Page136">[136]</span>
coal may be ascertained by the gas metre, or by the
gas holder, if the outlet valve of the latter be shut
during the distillatory process.</p>

<p>The heat at the same time employed for working
the retort, will be best defined for the stoker’s
guide, by copying carefully on paper the red tint
of the retort, as seen through the sight hole, made
for that purpose in the brick-work directly over the
fire-place.</p>

<p>The first six feet of the perpendicular pipe H, fig.
1, <a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a>, which conveys the distillatory products
from the retort, should be well cleaned out once a
month, the bonnet at the bended part of the pipe
H, fig. 1, is provided for that purpose, as already
stated, <a href="#Page119">page 119</a>.</p>

<p>When the retort remains uncharged, the fire
must be kept low in order to prevent its getting
beyond the usual temperature, and the arms and
moveable axis should be turned occasionally, and
the door kept close.</p>

<p>The fire tiles which cover the flues under the
retort should be examined about once a fortnight,
and if a tile is melted or broken, it must be replaced<span class="pagenum" id="Page137">[137]</span>
by a new one, because the preservation of the retort
greatly depends upon this precaution.</p>

<p>All the parts of the arms composing the moveable
disc within the retort, may be taken out of the
door of the retort, if they should require a repair,
first taking off the cap from the perpendicular pipe
E, fig. 1, <a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a>, surrounding the shaft of the
retort, then the centre piece, or rose centre, F, fig.
2, <a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a>, the shaft D, fig. 2, <a href="#PlateIII">plate III.</a>, may be
drawn up through the pipe which surrounds it.</p>

<p>When the retort requires cleaning, which should
be done once every six or eight months, a screw may
be attached to the upper extremity of the shaft D,
which passes through the retort; by this means, the
arms and rose centre within the retort can easily be
raised, to leave the bottom of the retort quite clear,
in order that the lumps of coke, that may be scattered
about, may be easily removed. And if an
incrustation of coke should happen to be attached
to the bottom of the retort, it may be readily detached
by a crow bar, or other suitable instrument.</p>

<p>The trays or coal boxes, fig. 12, <a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a>, may be
made by the stoker, of sheet iron, (called in commerce
No. 16,) framed upon a wooden mould made
for the purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page138">[138]</span></p>

<p>The temperature best suited for the decomposition
of coal by means of the horizontal rotary retort
depends, as has been already stated in the case of
cylindrical cast-iron retorts, altogether on the price
of coal, and the price which can be obtained for
the coke.</p>

<p>In all places where the average price of coal,
equal in quality to (Bewick and Craister’s Walls
End) Newcastle coal, or any other species of coal,
capable of producing from fifteen to eighteen thousand
feet of gas from one chaldron, is not less than
£ 2. 8s. the chaldron (27 Cwt.) or upwards, and where
coke can be sold at the average price of £. 1 the
chaldron, the horizontal rotary retort should be
worked at such a temperature, that when viewed
through the sight hole, it shall appear of a bright
cherry redness, and at which it produces from
15,000 to 16,000 cubic feet of gas, from a chaldron
of coal.</p>

<p>But in all other places where coal of the same
quality to (Bewick and Craister’s Walls End)
Newcastle coal, may be purchased at £. 1 8s. the
chaldron, or at a less price, it will be more advantageous
to the manufacturer, to work the horizontal<span class="pagenum" id="Page139">[139]</span>
rotary retort, at a lower temperature, so as to produce
only at the rate of thirteen or fourteen thousand
cubic feet of gas from the chaldron of coal.
In the latter case the manufacturer expends coal
in order to save his retort, whereas in the former
case he economizes the fuel, as productive of a gain
more than commensurate for the waste of the retort.</p>

<p>When the supply of gas required, happens at any
time to be less than the retort when in action is
capable of furnishing, the fire must then be kept
low, but the retort should never be suffered to acquire
a lower temperature, than that of a dull red
heat visible by day-light.</p>

<h3><i>Purifying Apparatus, or Lime Machine.</i></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="largecap">C</span>oal gas, even as obtained from the best species
of coal, must be rendered pure before it is fit for
the purpose of illumination. The gas in its crude
state always contains a portion of sulphuretted hydrogen
and carbonic acid; and when burnt, although
its illuminating power is greater in an impure than
in a pure state, it produces an oppressive and suffocating
odour, which is speedily perceptible in confined
places. The gaseous product evolved during
its combustion, blackens paint and tarnishes metallic
bodies; an impure gas besides strongly acts upon
the copper branch pipes through which it is
conveyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page141">[141]</span></p>

<p>To obviate these defects the sulphuretted hydrogen
and carbonic acid which are the cause of them
must be removed, and to effect this, no method
more economical and efficacious, has as yet been
discovered, than to bring the gas confined under a
pressure equal to a column of water, not less
than eight or ten inches in height, into contact with
quick-lime, diffused through water. Other means
have been tried, but all of them have failed to be
sufficiently efficacious or economical on a large
scale.</p>

<h3><i>Lime Machine originally employed for the
Purification of Coal Gas.</i></h3>

<p>In the lime-machine, until lately in use, the gas
was made to pass in the apparatus, through passages
which could not be guarded from being stopped up
in the course of time by the concretion of a quantity
of carbonate and hydro-sulphuret of lime, formed
during the purification of the gas, so that when the
stoppage occurred, a prodigious pressure was produced
in the machine, in consequence of which, it
was either found impossible to keep the distillatory<span class="pagenum" id="Page142">[142]</span>
apparatus air-tight, or if this was accomplished, a
great part of the gas was forced through the purifying
apparatus, without coming in contact with the
lime, by driving the column of mixture of lime and
water before it, and of course without being rendered
fit for use, previous to its passing into the gas reservoir.
This effect was unavoidable without the
precaution of employing a very dilute mixture of
quick-lime and water.</p>

<p>Numerous instances have also occurred where
from the increased pressure which the gas exerted
in the lime apparatus, the tar from the hydraulic
main was driven up with a prodigious force
through the dip pipe, P, fig. 2, <a href="#PlateIV">plate IV.</a>, into the
retort when the retort was opened, where it took fire
to the imminent danger of the whole establishment.</p>

<p>The apparatus originally employed was composed
of a large vessel closed on all sides to
receive the gas; within this was a smaller vessel
or lime trough open at top containing the quick-lime
and water; and there was also a third vessel, or
inverted trough into which the gas was received.</p>

<p>This inverted trough was open at bottom, and
the edge of the open part was immersed beneath<span class="pagenum" id="Page143">[143]</span>
the surface of the mixture of lime and water contained
in the lime-trough, so that the gas which
was introduced in the last-mentioned inverted
trough could not escape therefrom, except rising
up through the lime and water. To facilitate this,
holes or openings were made in the inverted trough
near the bottom edge thereof, and beneath the surface
of the purifying mixture, so that the bubbles of
gas were obliged to rise up through these openings.
From this construction of the machine the apertures
through which the gas had to pass, were extremely
liable to become stopped up, and dangerous consequences
ensued.</p>

<p>In order to remedy in some measure the evil,
a plan was adopted by Mr. Malam, for making the
gas to pass in thin strata underneath a series of
shelves, placed horizontally in the machine so as to
expose the gas in as large a surface as possible to
the contact of the lime and water, and employing
the purifying mixture at the same time in a more
dilute state:&mdash;this arrangement is as follows.</p>

<p>Fig. 4; <a href="#PlateV">plate V.</a>, represents a vertical section of the
machine; it is made of cast-iron plates, rendered air-tight
by screws, bolts, and iron cement. It consists of<span class="pagenum" id="Page144">[144]</span>
three separate chambers, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, destined to contain
the mixture of quick-lime and water. At the under
side of each chamber, is bolted a cylinder, <i>h</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>h</i>,
the lower extremity of which is furnished with a
large flanch, extending nearly to within the whole
inner diameter of the machine.</p>

<p>From the bottom of each of the chambers, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>,
proceeds a pipe curved upwards, and communicating
with a circular vessel, C, C, C, which serve for
the purpose of charging the chambers, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, with
the mixture of quick-lime and water, and regulating
the level of the fluid within the chambers. The
curved pipe likewise prevents the escape of the gas
when the contents of the chambers <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, are discharged.</p>

<p>The vessels, C, C, C, are provided with a waste
pipe and stop-cock, as shown in the sketch, for
discharging the contents of one chamber into the
chamber placed below it, and lastly into the reservoir
<i>e</i>.</p>

<p><i>b</i> <i>b</i>, are pipes which convey the gas into the
chambers, one extremity of each pipe communicates
with the cylinders <i>h</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>h</i>, and the other with the
chamber below it, and the lower pipe communicates<span class="pagenum" id="Page145">[145]</span>
with the valve M, so that by this means a communication
is formed from the lower cylinder <i>h</i>, to
the middle cylinder <i>h</i>, and from the middle to the
uppermost cylinder. K, is the exit pipe which
conveys the purified gas from the uppermost chamber
into the reservoir destined to receive it. Through
the centre of the machine passes a wrought-iron
shaft, furnished with agitators or arms, to stir up
the mixture of quick-lime and water. The arms
are not immediately connected with the shaft,
but proceed from cast-iron hydraulic cups, of the
usual construction, by this means the escape of the
gas is prevented, nor can the fluid pass from one
chamber into another. The axis is put in motion,
by wheel-work as shown in the design <i>e</i>, the handle
for turning the shaft.</p>

<p><i>g</i>, is a receiver to collect the condensible products.
The contents of this vessel may be discharged
by a hand pump being attached to the upper
extremity of the pipe <i>f</i>, after the cap with which it
is closed is removed.</p>

<p>The operation of this lime machine is obvious.
The gas first passes into the lowermost chamber
of the cylinder <i>h</i>, where it comes in contact<span class="pagenum" id="Page146">[146]</span>
with the purifying mixture and passes through
the fluid to the top of the same chamber, and
thence through the pipe <i>b</i>, into the cylinder above
it which communicates with the lower chamber,
where it is acted on again by the lime and water,
and bubbles up through the fluid to the top of the
chamber. From this compartment the gas passes
into the third cylinder, where it bubbles up and
passes through the lime and water; and lastly it
makes its exit through the pipe K, into the gasholder
or vessel destined to receive it.</p>

<p>When the mixture of quick-lime and water in the
compartments <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, of the machine, requires to be
renewed, it is let off by the stop-cock at the bottom
of the lowermost vessel into the reservoir <i>e</i>. The
fluid contained in the upper chamber may be
discharged into the chamber below it, and so on
with the chambers below it, care being taken to
close the stop-cock of the lower vessel. The machine
may be recharged at the uppermost chamber
with the purifying mixture. Fig. 5, exhibits the
plan of the machine. <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>, the tubes connecting
the chambers. B, the flanch of the cylinder <i>h</i>.</p>

<p>This machine has in part remedied the inconveniences<span class="pagenum" id="Page147">[147]</span>
stated <a href="#Page141">pages 141</a>, <a href="#Page142">142</a>, but the increase
in the quantity of the purifying materials which
the apparatus requires, is of itself productive of
most serious disadvantages.</p>

<p>The greater accumulation of waste lime which
such a practice occasions, renders it necessary
that capacious reservoirs and sewers should be constructed
to receive and carry off the refuse materials,
and where an outlet by such means cannot be
obtained, the carting away the increased quantities
of waste matter adds greatly to the cost of the
gas.</p>

<p>If attempts are made to convey the waste substances
into the common sewers or drains of the
neighbourhood, the proprietors of gas works are
exposed to indictments for a nuisance at the
suit of the inhabitants, and when the near proximity
of any river or lake induces an attempt
to convey the waste materials thither, the most
serious injury may be done to the water, which becoming
impregnated with hydrosulphuret of lime
is rendered unfit not only for domestic but for many
manufacturing purposes. The latter evil indeed
is one which operates also in a greater or lesser degree,<span class="pagenum" id="Page148">[148]</span>
even when the fœtid refuse or hydrosulphuret
is discharged into the common sewers, all of
which ultimately empty themselves into some water
course, rivulet or lake. I would here beg to suggest,
that considering how rapidly the new mode of
procuring light is extending throughout Britain,<a id="FNanchor37"></a><a href="#Footnote37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
and how much the waters of the country are liable
to be contaminated, from discharging into them the
noxious refuse from the process of purifying coal
gas, so as to be rendered proportionably unfit for
the various purposes of domestic and manufacturing
economy, it is well deserving the attention of the
legislature, whether such contamination ought not
to be guarded against by prohibiting enactments.</p>

Cheltenham, Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester, Exeter, Macclesfield,

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>It appears to me that it would be a wise exertion
of authority, to insert in every act of Parliament
granted for incorporating Gas-light Companies, a
clause prohibiting the proprietors from ever conveying
the waste material, or any other produce
from the manufacture of coal gas, either directly<span class="pagenum" id="Page149">[149]</span>
or indirectly into the common sewers, drains or
water courses, or into rivers and lakes adjacent.
The salubrity of the water we use is of as much
consequence to us, as any superior excellence or
saving of cost in our light can possibly be, and we
ought to take care that in profiting by an improvement
which science and art have discovered, we do
not unnecessarily depreciate one of those primary
blessings we owe to the bounty of nature.</p>

<h3><i>Lime Machine lately adopted.</i></h3>

<p>In the improved purifying apparatus<a id="FNanchor38"></a><a href="#Footnote38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> lately
brought into use, of which we shall now give an
account, a shaft or axis furnished with teeth or
claws, is applied within the interior of the
vessel, and made to act in such a manner as to scrape
out the openings or slits through which the gas has
to pass every time the axis is moved round, and by
which regular clearance all chance of stoppage is<span class="pagenum" id="Page150">[150]</span>
avoided without any augmentation of the purifying
mixture.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote38"></a><a href="#FNanchor38"><span class="label">[38]</span></a> This machine has been adopted at the gas works at Chester,
Birmingham, Kidderminster, Bristol, and in many other provincial
Gas Establishments.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The lime trough is also made moveable on a
centre or axis, in such a manner that it may readily
be inverted by a lever from the outside, for the
purpose of emptying its contents into the bottom
of an exterior vessel, from which the waste materials
may be discharged at pleasure.</p>

<p>With this machine we are farther enabled to employ
the purifying mixture in a semi-fluid state, and
consequently in a much less bulk; and after having
suffered it to remain in the reservoir destined to
receive it, the waste substance speedily acquires
such a degree of solidity that it may be dug out
with a spade and carted away in a small compass.
The safety of the apparatus is therefore insured and
the construction of expensive drains and sewers is
rendered unnecessary. The following description
will render the construction of the improved apparatus
obvious.</p>

<p>A, A, fig. 2, <a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a>, is a rectangular four-sided
prism, made of cast-iron plates, screwed together
air-tight with bolts and cement. The base of the
prism terminates in a rectangular four-sided pyramid<span class="pagenum" id="Page151">[151]</span>
placed with its apex downwards. It is surrounded
by an iron stage, supported upon pillars,
as shown in the design.</p>

<p>Within this vessel, which in fact composes only
the outer case of the apparatus, is contained an
oblong trough B, fig. 2, <a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a>, (it is shown in
the design as if broken down), moveable upon an
horizontal axis, fixed to one of its longest sides,
so that by means of the wheel C, or lever communicating
with the axis, and applied on the outside of
the machine, the trough B, may be inverted, and
its contents discharged into the exterior case, or
lower part A, A, of the machine. The part B, of
the machine is called the lime trough, because it is
destined to contain the quick-lime and water, by
means of which the crude coal gas is purified.
Within this trough B, is inverted an oblong rectangular
box D, closed at top and open at bottom,
called the air-box, because it receives the gas to
be purified.</p>

<p>In each of the longest sides of the box D, are
perpendicular openings or slits (as shown in the design)
exactly opposite to each other. Through the
whole length of this box D, passes a horizontal axis
furnished with as many teeth or claws as there are upright<span class="pagenum" id="Page152">[152]</span>
openings, through each side of the box.
These claws extend a little way through the openings
so that when the axis, which passes through a stuffing
box, is made to revolve by means of the handle X, the
ends of the claws pass through the openings and
scrape them out every time the axis is turned. The
claws operate first on the openings of one side of the
box and then on those on the opposite side. They
pass quite through and therefore keep them clear;
those parts of the claws which enter into the openings
are narrow in the direction of their motion,
and that part of each claw which is nearest to the
centre, is broad and flat, hence they act as paddles
or rowers whilst they are in motion, to stir up the
quick-lime and water.</p>

<p>Fig. 10, <a href="#PlateIII">plate III.</a>, represents a transverse section
of this part of the apparatus. B, B, is the lime
trough; D, the air box inverted into the lime
trough; the dotted circle shows the sweep of the
claws when the shaft is put in motion. The darts
show the course of the gas.</p>

<p>Fig. 10, <a href="#PlateVI">plate VI.</a>, represents a plan of the machine.
G, shows the inverted air-trough with its axis, and
the claws or teeth fixed upon the axis. H, is the
lime trough. A, the outer case of the machine; R,<span class="pagenum" id="Page153">[153]</span>
R, the axis, to which is affixed the wheel or lever, for
inverting the trough H. L, the axis and handle to
give motion to the shaft upon which the claws
are fixed, for stirring up the contents of the lime
trough.</p>

<p>The inverted air-box D, fig. 2, <a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a>, is supported
within the outer case of the machine A, A,
fig. 2, <a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a>, by cross bars, and the axis is put in
motion by the handle X, on the outside of the machine.
It is rendered air-tight by a stuffing box, and
is provided with wheel-work, as shewn in the design,
fig. 2, <a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a>, to communicate the motion to the
axis.</p>

<p>The gas is brought into the air box by the pipe
N, fig. 3, which proceeds from the tar vessel, fig.
3, <a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a> The gas cannot escape out of the machine
without displacing the column of fluid in the
lime trough, in order to make its way through the
openings or upright slits in the side of the air box
D, and thus bubbling up through the mixture of
quick-lime and water, the depth of which is one
foot. The sulphuretted hydrogen and carbonic acid
being thus made to combine with the lime, the
carburetted hydrogen is left more or less pure, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page154">[154]</span>
is conveyed into the gas metre, by the pipe V,
where it is to be measured, and from thence by the
pipe W, fig. 4, into the gas-holder.</p>

<p>When the purifying mixture is to be removed,
the workman unbolts the wheel C, fig. 2, and turns
it half way round; (if the emptying of the lime
trough requires more power than can conveniently
be applied by means of the wheel, the axis of the
trough may be worked with a tooth and pinion, a
small wheel being attached to the axis of the pinion
as a perpetual handle;) this motion inverts the lime
trough B, and its contents become discharged into
the outer case forming the inverted pyramid of
the apparatus, whence the waste materials may be
conveyed into the reservoir or pit Q, by drawing
open the sliding valve <i>o</i>, fig. 2, <a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a>, or <i>o</i>, fig. 3,
<a href="#PlateVII">plate VII.</a>, added for that purpose to the discharging
pipe P, fig. 2, <a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a>, or <i>p</i>, fig. 3, <a href="#PlateVII">plate VII.</a> To
prevent the air entering into the machine when the
waste lime is discharged, the lower extremity of the
outlet pipe P, dips into the basin Q, fig. 2, <a href="#PlateII">plate
II.</a>, which always contains a portion of the waste
fluid and thus seals the extremity of the pipe P.</p>

<p>One side of the lime-machine is provided with<span class="pagenum" id="Page155">[155]</span>
two large lenses, to admit light into the interior of
the apparatus, so that by means of an eye-glass fixed
in a proper place, the workman is enabled to see
into the interior of the apparatus. And when
the machine requires to be cleaned out, the <i>manhole</i>
as it is called, is opened for the workmen to
enter into the apparatus to remove any solid incrustation
of carbonate of lime, or hydrosulphuret of
lime that may happen to be formed in the lime
trough, or any other part of the apparatus.</p>

<p>The wheel C, is loaded with a counter-weight,
to balance the weight of the lime trough. To bring
the lime trough again into a proper position, to be
re-charged with a fresh portion of the purifying
mixture, the workman turns the wheel C half round,
the contrary way to that which caused the trough to
be turned topside-down, and the trough may then be
re-filled with a fresh portion of lime and water from
the reservoir R, fig. 2, <a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a>, (or R, fig. 3, <a href="#PlateVII">plate
VII.</a>,) containing the mixture ready prepared. Y,
is a pipe to bring water from a cistern into the lime
reservoir R. The prepared lime which is to supply
the machine is put into the vessel R, and a sufficiency<span class="pagenum" id="Page156">[156]</span>
of water being mixed with it, the mixture is
stirred up to the consistence of a semi-fluid mass.</p>

<p>T, shows the pipe furnished with a sliding
valve S, for conveying the purifying mixture of
quicklime and water into the lime trough from the
reservoir R, which is furnished with an agitator to
stir up its contents.</p>

<p>To give motion to the shaft for stirring up the
contents of the lime trough D, the inventor of this
machine (Mr. Clegg,) has happily applied the gas,
to act as a power for that purpose. This operation
will be explained hereafter in describing the gas
metre.</p>

<p>The pipe N, which conveys away the purified
gas, proceeds from an hydraulic valve, to cut off the
communication between the gas holder and the
lime machine, if occasion should require it, and to
prevent the gas from passing back from the gas
holder into the lime machine.</p>

<p>It consists of a box containing water into which
dips a small pipe, by means of which the gas passes
out of the lime machine, and from thence into the
pipe V, communicating with the gas metre. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page157">[157]</span>
box is furnished with a tube curved upwards to
discharge the water when it accumulates above the
required height, and to prevent any quantity being
thrown out of the hydraulic valve, by the concussion
of the fluid in the lime trough.</p>

<p>One cubic foot capacity of the lime trough is
sufficient to purify 1000 cubic feet of gas obtained
from Newcastle coal in twenty-four hours.</p>

<h3><i>Test Apparatus, for certifying the purity of
coal gas, and the proper manner of working
the Lime Machine.</i></h3>

<p>The proper purification of the gas being a
matter of essential importance, as already illustrated
<a href="#Page140">page 140</a>, it becomes of great consequence to have
some ready means of ascertaining whether the
workman does his duty in this respect, by keeping
the lime trough D, fig. 2, <a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a>, properly
charged with the requisite quantity of lime and
water necessary for the purification of the gas.</p>

<p>For this purpose an apparatus has been adapted
by Mr. Clegg to the lime machine, which serves
not only to indicate the quantity of fluid contained<span class="pagenum" id="Page158">[158]</span>
in the machine when gas is manufactured,
but which also enables the workmen to appreciate
the quantity of quick-lime necessary for the purification
of the gas, and to ascertain its purity.
The apparatus consists of a closed cup C, fig. 23,
<a href="#PlateIV">plate IV.</a>, partly filled with any coloured liquid. Into
this cup is cemented, air-tight, a straight glass tube
<i>a</i>, about 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> feet long and a <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> of an inch in the bore;
the lower extremity of the tube nearly touches the
bottom of the cup, and is therefore sealed by the
fluid. <i>d</i>, <i>d</i>, is a small copper tube, which forms a
communication between the air confined above the
surface of the fluid in the guage cup C, and the
gas which is proceeding into the lime-trough.</p>

<p>The communication may be established at any
part of the pipe which conveys the gas into
the lime machine. When the connection is
made, the fluid in the guage cup C, will be
driven up into the perpendicular measuring tube
<i>a</i>, by the pressure of the gas, to an altitude
equal to a column of liquid contained in the
lime-trough. It is essential that the tube <i>a</i>, be
at least 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> feet in height, if the depth of the lime-trough
is one foot, for without this precaution, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page159">[159]</span>
fluid will rise out of the tube in consequence of
the oscillation which it suffers. By this means the
overseer of the works will be enabled, by mere
inspection, to know whether the workmen have
charged the lime trough with the mixture of
quick-lime and water to the requisite height,
which should never be less than from ten to
fifteen inches. Because the abstraction of the sulphuretted
hydrogen and carbonic acid gas, from
the carburetted hydrogen with which it is combined,
is greatly facilitated by pressure, and there
is no inconvenience whatever in operating under
a pressure of a column of fluid of even double the
height that has been stated, provided the apparatus
is properly constructed. From experiments made
on this subject, I am justified in stating that
one half of the quantity of quick-lime that is required
for the purification of coal gas in the
ordinary way, is sufficient, if the column of the
liquid opposed to the gas is raised to twenty inches
high, nor is the evolution of the gas in any degree
retarded under such a pressure.</p>

<p>The curved tube <i>d d</i>, which is cemented air-tight
into the gauge cup <i>c</i>, has a free communication<span class="pagenum" id="Page160">[160]</span>
with the gas in the guage cup <i>c</i>. It serves to
enable the workmen to form some notion of the
chemical constitution of the crude gas, before it
passes into the lime machine. For if the stop cock
<i>e</i> of the tube be opened, and the descending leg <i>a</i>
of the bended tube <i>d</i> be immersed in a glass containing
a solution of super acetate of lead, some
notion may be formed by a little practice of the
quantity of lime requisite for the purification of
the gas, from the quantity of (black precipitate)
hydrosulphuret of lead produced. Two per cent of
quick-lime to the coal employed (if Newcastle coal) is
usually sufficient for the complete abstraction of all
the sulphuretted hydrogen and carbonic acid, contained
in the crude gas, provided the operation be
carried on under a pressure of not less than a
column of water twelve inches in height.</p>

<p>The test tube <i>f</i>, properly so called, may be
adapted to any part of the pipe which conveys the
purified gas to its place of destination. It serves to
ascertain the purity of the gas, after it has been acted
on by quick-lime, by suffering the gas to pass
from the tube into a solution of super acetate
of lead, which speedily becomes discoloured, if the<span class="pagenum" id="Page161">[161]</span>
gas contains sulphuretted hydrogen. The presence
of carbonic acid is rendered obvious, by a white
precipitate being produced when the gas is made to
pass through barytic water. The precipitate, which
is carbonate of barytes, effervesces with acids.</p>

<p>It must be obvious that the apparatus which we
have now been describing does not require to be
placed in the immediate vicinity of the gas light
machinery. It may be arranged in the counting-house
of the overseer, who, by mere inspection, can
then at all times detect the slightest irregularity or
insufficiency in the process thus given to the gas
light manufacture, a degree of scientific controul
of which few arts can boast.</p>

<p>The following method has been found economical
and convenient, for preserving quick-lime in
a ready state, fit for the purification of coal gas.</p>

<p>Take the lime as soon as possible after it is burnt;
put it into a pit eight or ten feet long, five or six
wide, and five or six deep, constructed of brick-work
and level with the ground. By this pit set a wooden
trough about six feet long, three feet broad, and
two feet deep. The trough should have at one end
a hole about six inches square, covered with an iron<span class="pagenum" id="Page162">[162]</span>
grating, the bars of which are a quarter of an
inch distant. Let this grating be provided with a
slider, which can occasionally be drawn up to uncover,
or pushed down to cover, the grating. Put
three or four bushels of lime at a time into the
trough; throw water on it, and mix it up into a
thick fluid mass with a hoe perforated with holes.
When there is a good quantity of liquid, draw up
the slider and let the slacked lime run into the pit.
Throw more water on the remaining unslacked
lime, and lastly reject those pieces which will not
slack. The trough should have a small inclination
and project over the pit.</p>

<p>After the lime thus slacked has been five or six
hours in the pit, it will take the consistence of a
stiff paste, which it retains for years. It should then
be kept covered to keep it clean and to exclude the
free contact of the air. For those who use larger
quantities of lime, several pits should be constructed
in preference to one larger reservoir. When the
lime is wanted for use it may be dug out with a
spade, and readily diluted with a sufficient quantity
of water.</p>

<p>The quick-lime thus prepared forms a perfect homogeneous<span class="pagenum" id="Page163">[163]</span>
mixture. The practice of throwing lime
simply slackened into the lime cistern is a wasteful
and slovenly process, as will becomes obvious on
examining the waste hydrosulphuret of lime discharged
from the machine, which will be found to
abound with lime in a concrete form, unacted on
by the substances with which it was intended to
combine.</p>

<h3><i>Gas Holder.</i></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="largecap">T</span>he name of gas holder, or, as it is improperly
called, gasometer, is given to the vessel employed
for collecting the gas and storing it up for use. In
the principle and construction of this part of the
gas light machinery, peculiarly valuable improvements
have of late been made. They have contributed
to lessen the expence of the apparatus so
much, that a reservoir for storing up any quantity
of gas, may now be furnished for nearly one half
the sum which such a vessel cost as originally
constructed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page165">[165]</span></p>

<p>In the infancy of the art of lighting with coal
gas, the reservoir was encumbered with a heavy appendage
of chains, wheel-work and balance weights,
and from the construction of the machine, it was
necessary to guard it from the impulse of the wind,
the action of which on the gas holder, would have
rendered the lights which the machine supplied
with gas, unsteady.</p>

<p>Hence it was necessary to inclose the gas holder
in a building, called the gasometer house, which
formed one of the largest items of expenditure
which the proprietor of a gas light establishment
was called upon to defray.</p>

<p>Now, however, the whole of these expensive
appendages is dispensed with, nor is the gasometer
house to contain the gas holder any longer necessary,
and the machine as now constructed may be
fixed in the open air.</p>


<h3><i>Gas Holder as originally employed.</i></h3>

<p>The gas holder, of the original construction, consists
of two principal parts; first, of a cistern or
reservoir of water, usually constructed of masonry,
or of cast-iron plates, bolted and screwed together;<span class="pagenum" id="Page166">[166]</span>
and secondly, of an air-tight vessel which is closed at
top and open at bottom, inverted with its open end
downwards into the cistern of water. This vessel
is always made of sheet-iron plates rivetted together
air-tight, and was suspended by a chain or chains,
passing over wheels, supported by a frame work.</p>

<p>If the common air be allowed to escape from the
inner vessel, when its open end is under the edge
of the water in the outer cistern, it will freely descend,
and water will occupy the place of the air; but
if the avenue of the escape be stopped, and air be
made to pass through the water, the suspended
inverted vessel will rise to make room for the air.
And, again, if the suspended vessel be counterpoised
by a weight, so as to allow it to be a little heavier
than the quantity of water which it displaces, it
will descend, if, the entering gas be withdrawn
through an outlet made in the vessel to permit the
gas to escape. But if the outlet be stopped, and air
again be admitted under the vessel, it will rise again.
The apparatus, therefore, is not only a reservoir for
storing up the gas introduced into it, but serves to
expel the gas which it contains, when required,<span class="pagenum" id="Page167">[167]</span>
into the pipes and mains connected with this machine.</p>

<p>According to this construction of the apparatus
the interior inverted vessel forms strictly what is
termed the gas holder. It is suspended as already
stated in the outer cistern, by a chain or chains,
passing over pullies, supported by blocks and frame
work, and to the chain there is affixed a counterpoise
balance, of such a relative weight, as to allow the
gas holder a slow descent into the water, in order
to propel the gas into the mains or vessel destined
to receive it, with a very small and uniform
weight.</p>

<p>It will be obvious, that when a gas holder of this
construction becomes immersed in the water, it
loses as much of its weight as is equal to the bulk
of water which it displaces, and hence to render its
descent uniform, and to preserve the gas within,
of an invariable density, at any degree of immersion,
a greater counterpoise is required as the gas holder
rises out of the water.</p>

<p>Among various methods which have been
adopted to attain this object, the ends of the chains
by which the gas holder is suspended, have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page168">[168]</span>
fastened in separate grooves, in the edge of a large
wheel or pulley, of such a diameter, that the gas
holder rises to its full height, before the wheel
makes one revolution.</p>

<p>In another groove in the edge of the same wheel,
was fixed the end of another chain, to which a
balance weight was suspended. This weight was
made nearly equal to the weight of the gas holder.
To equalize the density of the gas within the gas
holder, at any degree of immersion of the vessel,
the weight chain was made to pass over a wheel,
furnished with a spiral groove, so as to make the
radii of the wheel, change reciprocally with the
relative weight of the gas holder, and consequently
to render the pressure of the gas holder constant
and uniform.</p>

<p>Another and more elegant method of obtaining an
uniform elasticity of the gas within the gas holder,
and which has been more generally adopted, consists
in passing the chain or chains by which the
gas holder is suspended over a pully or wheels, and
making the weight of that portion of the chain,
which is equal to the depth of the gas holder, or
that part of it which becomes immersed into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page169">[169]</span>
water, equal to one half of the weight of the specific
gravity of the gas holder.</p>

<p>It is obvious that before the purified gas can be
admitted into the gas holder, the vessel must be
allowed to descend to the bottom of the exterior
cistern, in order to get rid of the common air which
it contains. This may be effected rapidly by opening
the <i>man hole</i> at the top of the gas holder, to
cause the vessel to descend completely into the outer
cistern filled with water. The man hole is then
screwed up again air-tight, and the machine is ready
to receive the gas. It is obvious that the operation
of opening the man hole for letting out the common
air, requires only to be done once prior to the commencing
of the working of the apparatus.</p>


<h3><i>Gas Holder with Governor, or Regulating
Gauge, lately brought into use.</i></h3>

<p>It must be obvious that the gas holder, of which
a description has been given in the preceding page,
requires a machinery at once ponderous and very
delicate, qualities not easily reconciled in the
construction of such a machine. It is necessary<span class="pagenum" id="Page170">[170]</span>
that the specific gravity apparatus, or regulating
chain, wheel work and balance weight, should be
constructed so correctly as never to suffer the gas
within the vessel, to alter its elasticity. The machinery
requires an expensive framing for its support,
and independently of this, the gas holder
must be inclosed in a building, in order to protect
it from the impulse of the wind, the action of which
would render the lights supplied from the apparatus
unsteady, as already stated. The expensive and
cumbersome specific gravity apparatus has been
wholly superseded by an ingenious contrivance
called the regulator or governor. The action of this
machine, for which we are indebted to Mr. Clegg,
is, that it regulates the density of the gas prior to
its entering into the mains, to any required degree,
whatever its density may be in the gas holder.</p>

<p>To accomplish this object, the apparatus through
which the gas passes into the mains, is provided
with an aperture which is capable of being enlarged
or diminished by a very slight force. To effect
this object the gas is made to enter a small
vessel, and then to pass through a regulating aperture,
the capacity of which becomes enlarged or<span class="pagenum" id="Page171">[171]</span>
diminished by the velocity of the gas to a certain
standard. If the pressure of the gas in the gas
holder becomes increased, the regulating aperture
through which the gas passes into the mains, becomes
diminished, in such a proportion, that the
velocity with which the gas issues into the mains,
remains constant and uniform. And on the other
hand, if the pressure of the gas in the gas holder
becomes diminished, the regulating aperture of the
governor becomes enlarged to effect the intended
regulation.</p>

<p>The following is a concise description of the
manner in which this instrument is constructed.</p>

<p><i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, <i>D</i>, fig. 9, <a href="#PlateIII">pl. III.</a> is a hollow cylindrical
vessel, or the outer case of the machine. It is made
of sheet iron or copper, japanned within and without,
closed at the top and bottom. It is placed
between the gas holder and the mains, into which
the gas is to be conveyed. <i>a</i>, <i>x</i>, is a pipe which
proceeds from the outer vessel and branches upwards
in the centre of the base of the outer vessel
A, B, C, D. It brings the purified gas into the
governor. <i>b</i>, T, is the outlet pipe which conveys the
gas from the governor into the mains. It is placed<span class="pagenum" id="Page172">[172]</span>
above the inlet pipe and communicates with the
interior vessel. G, H, a short projecting hollow
cylinder, which proceeds downwards from the
centre of the base of the outer case of the
machine A, B, C, D. <i>u</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, is the regulator,
properly so called; it consists of a small conical
vessel, also made of sheet iron or copper, closed
at the top and open at bottom, japanned within
and without. This vessel rises and falls vertically
in the outer cylindrical case. A, B, C, D,
of the machine, when the latter is filled with water.
It is kept steady in its motion by two slender guide
rods, as shewn in the sketch.</p>

<p>Between the inlet pipe which conveys the
gas into the governor, and the outlet pipe which
conveys the gas into the mains, is fixed horizontally
a partition plate, having a circular aperture
in the centre. This plate is seen between the
letters <i>x</i>, T.</p>

<p>Through this orifice passes a perpendicular axis
P, which is fixed at the top in the centre of the
regulator or interior floating vessel <i>u</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>.</p>

<p>The interior extremity of the axis P, is furnished
with a cone, having its base downwards, and projecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page173">[173]</span>
beyond the pipe <i>a</i>, <i>x</i>, into the short
cylinder G, H. The base of this cone slightly
exceeds the diameter of the orifice <i>x</i>, T, so as to
close up entirely, when the regulator is raised to
its greatest height in the outer vessel A, B, C, D.
But when the floating vessel <i>u</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, descends in
the outer vessel A, B, C, the vertex of the adjusting
cone P, is just entering the aperture.</p>

<p>The regulator is conical, and its form is in exact
proportion to the loss of the weight of water which
it displaces; so that the gas conveyed into it always
retains an invariable density at whatever height the
regulator may be immersed in the water in the
outer vessel. If the outer vessel be filled with water
up to the top of the central branch pipe, the interior
vessel will float, and the water will stand in the
outer vessel at the same height as in the inside of
the regulator; hence the density of the gas within
will be the same as the outer air. But the density
of the gas in the regulator may be increased at
pleasure by applying a weight to the top of the
regulator, the water will then stand higher on the
outside of the regulator than within, and this
adjustment will remain uniform, because the quantity<span class="pagenum" id="Page174">[174]</span>
of matter of the regulator is in the ratio of its
specific gravity or loss of weight as it becomes
immersed in the water.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that the pipe above the partition
plate be connected with a main, and that
the outlet pipe below the partition plate be connected
with a gas holder supplying gas into the
machine; it will be evident that if the density of the
gas in the inlet pipe becomes by any means increased,
a greater quantity of gas must pass betwixt the
sides of the adjusting cone and the aperture in the
partition plate, the consequence of which will be
that the floating regulator will rise, and therefore
contract the area of the partition plate. And if,
on the contrary, the gas in the inlet pipe decreases
in density the regulator will descend, so that whatever
density the gas may at any time assume in
the gas holders or mains, its density in the floating
vessel <i>u</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, will remain uniform, and consequently
the velocity of the gas passing into the
mains will be regular.</p>

<p>For when the aperture of the partition plate
would admit more gas than what is necessary
for the density of the gas in the mains, the floating<span class="pagenum" id="Page175">[175]</span>
regulator rises, and by that means raises the
adjusting cone to diminish the aperture in the
partition plate, and when, on the contrary, the
aperture does not allow a sufficient quantity of gas
to come from the gas holders, the gas passes out of
the regulator into the mains, and in so doing the
regulator descends, and consequently the adjusting
cone increases the opening to admit the requisite
gas into the mains.</p>

<p>The further application of this machine, for
regulating the height of the gas flames issuing
from burners or lamps of different kinds will be
shewn hereafter.</p>


<h3><i>Gas Holder with Governor or Regulating
Guage at the Gas Works Chester.</i></h3>

<p>Fig. 7, <a href="#PlateVI">plate VI.</a>, exhibits a perpendicular section
of the gas holder at Chester. A, A, are wooden
beams or pillars fixed into sockets or shafts constructed
on the outside of the brick-work, and
descending as seen in the design to the depth of
the tank. There are four of these pillars, three
only are seen in the section. B, B, are round iron<span class="pagenum" id="Page176">[176]</span>
guide rods rendered steady by stays at the upper
extremity of the rods.</p>

<p>To the upper and lower edges of the gas holder
are fastened eye bolts, C, C, through which the
guide rods, B, B, are inserted, so that the gas
holder must move steadily and firmly. D, E, are
the inlet and outlet pipes which convey the gas
into and out of the gas holder.</p>

<p>F, F, are diagonal stays for supporting the roof
of the gas holder, which has a slope of ten feet from
the centre to the circumference. G, is the wooden
curb at the lower margin of the machine.</p>

<p>This gas holder is circular. It measures forty-eight
feet in diameter, and thirteen feet in height;
its weight is eight tons.</p>

<p>The regulator adapted to this gas holder, measures
three feet across its base, and its height is
three feet three inches. The base of the regulating
cone is four inches, and its length two feet. The
machine is made of sheet iron japanned within and
without.</p>

<h3><i>Gas Holder with Governor or Regulating Guage
at the Birmingham Gas Works.</i></h3>

<p>The construction of this gas holder, as exhibited
<a href="#PlateV">plate V.</a>, fig. 2, shows a perpendicular section, and
fig. 3, a plan of the machine; <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, fig. 3,
are upright pillars, two of which B, B, are seen in
the section, fig. 2.</p>

<p>In the centre of the gas holder is fixed a pipe,
which allows the gas holder to slide on the central
guide rod G, made fast at the bottom of the cistern,
and at the top of the cross framing. C, C, are diagonal
stays; D, the inlet pipe which conveys the
gas into the gas holder E; the outlet pipe F, the
wooden curb.</p>

<p>The capacity of this gas holder is 30,000 cubic
feet; its regulator is precisely similar to that before
described. The weight of the gas holder, exclusive
of the wooden curbs at top and bottom, is between
eight and nine tons.<a id="FNanchor39"></a><a href="#Footnote39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote39"></a><a href="#FNanchor39"><span class="label">[39]</span></a> The gas holder without specific gravity apparatus, at the Bristol
Gas Works, is constructed on a similar principle. Its capacity is
43,000 cubic feet. Its regulator is like those already described.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The gas holder thus disencumbered of its specific<span class="pagenum" id="Page178">[178]</span>
gravity apparatus, requires no building to enclose
it, it may be erected in the open air, for the machine
cannot suffer from the rain or snow falling upon it,
nor can the action of the wind render the lights
unsteady.</p>

<p>The saving which has been effected by these improvements
is very great. A gas holder without
balance weight and specific gravity apparatus, with
its governor, may be erected complete for action,
for little more than half the cost that would be required
for the erection of an apparatus of the same
capacity constructed on the old plan.</p>

<p>The cheapest house constructed of sheet iron to
surround a circular gas holder of 15,000 cubic feet
capacity, supposing the surface of its cistern or
tank to be level with the ground, costs no less
than £. 320. The balance weights and chains
£. 60, and the cast-iron framing for supporting the
specific gravity machinery £. 150.</p>

<p>The cost of a gas holder of the before-mentioned
capacity, will be £. 300, and a cast-iron tank
for it, £. 800.&mdash;If the tank be constructed of
brick-work, it will cost about £. 500, and if of wood
(an iron-bound vat,) it will cost £. 600.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page179">[179]</span></p>

<p>A governor or regulating guage adapted to a gas
holder of from 10,000 to 40,000 cubic feet capacity,
costs £. 50. In the construction of the gas holders,
as hitherto described, it is always advisable when
the situation will admit it, that the diameter to the
height of the machine should be in the proportion
as three to two. If these dimensions be observed,
and the gas holder is not burdened by iron stays,
it will not displace a column of water more than
one inch and a half in height. And by adapting
to the machine, a governor or regulating guage,
a considerable saving will be effected. The gas
holder may then be constructed as shown fig. 7,
<a href="#PlateVI">plate VI.</a>, or fig. 2, <a href="#PlateV">plate V.</a> A circular gas holder
of 30,000 cubic feet capacity, if properly constructed,
weighs no more than eight or nine tons,
including its wooden curb at its lowest extremity,
and its diagonal stays.<a id="FNanchor40"></a><a href="#Footnote40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<h3><i>Revolving Gas Holder at the Westminster
Gas Works.</i></h3>

<p>The revolving gas holder is an ingenious contrivance
invented by Mr. Clegg, for storing large
quantities of gas. A gas holder of this construction
may be erected with advantage in situations
where the nature of the ground will not
admit of a deep cistern either above or below the
ground being constructed, without an enormous
expence.</p>

<p>The base which it occupies is no larger than
what would be required for a gas holder of equal
capacity, built on the plan of the gas holders of
which descriptions have been just given.</p>

<p>It regulates its own specific gravity. And though
more expensive in the construction, yet as it does
not require a deep cistern, like the machines already
described, it can be erected at the same cost. The
revolving gas holder is exhibited, fig. 8, <a href="#PlateVI">plate VI.</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page182">[182]</span>
Its capacity is 15,000 cubic feet; it weighs 12 tons.
<a href="#PlateI">Plate I.</a>, (on the title page,) exhibits a perpendicular
section of the gas holder.</p>

<p>On inspecting fig. 8, <a href="#PlateVI">plate VI.</a>, it will be seen
that this machine is the segment of a hollow
cylinder, or broad wheel, formed by two concentric
cylindric surfaces of 250° each, revolving upon an
horizontal axis, and supported upon a wooden
frame or truss, in a brick cistern, I, K, L.</p>

<p>The extremity C, D, fig. 8, <a href="#PlateVI">plate VI.</a>, or C,
<a href="#PlateI">plate I.</a>, of the segment of the cylinder, is open,
and the other extremity A, is closed. E, is a
balance pipe, which connects the closed with the
open extremity of the machine.</p>

<p>This pipe is made of such a weight as to counterpoise
the interval between the open and closed end
of the gas holder, so that the machine may move in
a segment of a circle equally, in whatever position
it may happen to be placed, and hence the gas will
be discharged from the gas holder with an uniform
velocity.</p>

<p>The balance pipe E, is closed at the part where
the letter E is placed; H, is a straight pipe, which
forms the communication between the balance<span class="pagenum" id="Page183">[183]</span>
pipe E, and the horizontal axis upon which the
machine moves. This axis is hollow: it is supported
by stays and braces, as shown in the design
on the title page. The cistern in which the gas
holder moves is 7<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> feet deep. It must be evident
that the gas being conveyed into the open end of
the hollow axis, it will pass through the pipe H,
into the balance pipe E, and this being stopped up
near E, the gas will proceed into the closed end
of the gas holder. The operation will therefore
be as follows:</p>

<p>Let us suppose the closed extremity of the
machine to be at the surface of the water in the
cistern, and the gas flowing through the axis as
described, the extremity of the machine will begin
to fill, and consequently to ascend; the gas holder
will therefore continue to move upon its axis until
the open end C, D, fig. 8, <a href="#PlateVI">plate VI.</a>, or C, <a href="#PlateI">plate I.</a>,
comes nearly to the surface of the water, and when
the gas is required to be discharged, it will return
through the same channel by which it entered. A
sufficient pressure is given to this gas holder for discharging
the gas at the velocity required, by means
of a weight suspended to one extremity of a chain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page184">[184]</span>
passing over a pulley, whilst the other end is
fastened into the groove of a small circle attached to
the stays of the machine, as shown in the designs.
The circle is graduated to express the capacity of
the machine. Thus any degree of pressure may be
given to the gas, and the gas holder will retrograde
in an arc describing 270° of a circle, as the gas
becomes discharged, until the end A, again arrives
at the surface of the water.</p>

<p>The small curved pipe T, <a href="#PlateI">plate I.</a>, serves to let
the common air escape out of the angular extremity
of the machine, whilst filling with gas, when the
margin of this part of the machine becomes immersed
in the water, and to let the common air
enter again, when the gas holder is discharging
its contents.</p>

<p>S, <a href="#PlateI">plate I.</a>, is a friction sector, upon which the
axis of the machine revolves. The advantage of
this contrivance is, that the friction is very much
diminished. The length of the friction sector is
eight feet, the diameter of the gudgeon or axis four
inches; therefore the space described by its outer
circumference and its centre is in the proportion
of 96 to 4.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page185">[185]</span></p>

<h3><i>Rule for finding the capacity of a Revolving
Gas Holder of given dimensions.</i></h3>

<p>To find the capacity of a revolving gas holder,
of given dimensions, take the area of the whole
diameter, then the area of the inner cylinder, multiply
the difference by the length, and from this
deduct one-fourth.</p>

<h3><i>Collapsing Gas Holder.</i></h3>

<p>The collapsing gas holder is a still farther improvement
by Mr. Clegg, on this part of the gas
light apparatus, and certainly of all the contrivances
which have been invented for collecting and storing
up large quantities of gas, this machine must be
pronounced to be by far the most simple, economical,
and efficient. The striking advantage of the revolving
gas holder which we have just been describing
is, that it enables the dimensions of the tank to
be very much diminished, where the nature of the
ground will not admit of a cistern of great depth
being sunk, except at an extraordinary expence;
but the still superior feature of the collapsing gas
holder which we now come to describe, is, that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page186">[186]</span>
may be constructed of any required capacity, and
adapted to a tank or cistern of such diminished
depth, as scarcely to deserve that name. It requires
a sheet of water no more than 18 inches in height,
so that it may be constructed in or upon ground of
all descriptions, not only with every possible facility,
but at an immense saving of expence.</p>

<p>Fig. 1, <a href="#PlateVII">plate VII.</a>, exhibits a perspective view of
this gas holder. It is composed of<a id="FNanchor43"></a><a href="#Footnote43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> two quadrangular
side plates joined to two end plates, meeting
together at top in a ridge, like the roof of a house.
The side and end plates are united together by
air tight hinges, and the joints are covered with
leather, to allow the side plates to fold together
and to open in the manner of a portfolio. The
bottom edges of the gas holder are immersed in a
shallow cistern of water, to confine the gas. By the
opening out or closing up of the sides and ends of
the gas holder, its internal capacity is enlarged or
diminished, and this variation of capacity is effected
without a deep tank of water to immerse the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page187">[187]</span>
gas holder in, as required in the ordinary construction
of rising and falling gas holders. The collapsing
gas holder requires therefore only a very
shallow trough of water to immerse the bottom
edges of the gas holder to prevent the escape of the
gas introduced into it. The lower edges of the gas
holder which dip in water are made to move in an
horizontal plane or nearly so, when they are opened,
so that they dip very little deeper in the water when
shut or folded together, than when opened out.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote43"></a><a href="#FNanchor43"><span class="label">[43]</span></a> From Mr. Clegg’s specification&mdash;the same letters of reference
indicate the same parts in all the designs.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>For this purpose the top or ridge joints which
unite the two sides of the gas holder, are slightly
raised up when the sides close or approach together,
or slightly depressed when the sides open out or
recede from each other. To guide the whole gas
holder in this movement, two perpendicular rods
rise from the bottom of the shallow tank which pass
through sockets in the ridge joints at the upper part
of the gas holder. These sockets are secured by collars
of leather round the shafts or rods, to prevent
the escape of the gas, and they are braced by chains
proceeding from their upper extremities and fastened
at the ground on each side of the tank.</p>

<p>The weight of the gas holder is balanced by levers<span class="pagenum" id="Page188">[188]</span>
bent in the form of the letter L, and placed inside
of the gas holder. These levers move on centre pins
fixed at the bottom of the shallow trough, which
pass through the angles of the L levers. The perpendicular
arms of the levers are jointed at their
upper extremities to the sides of the gas holder,
nearly in the middle. At the ends of the horizontal
arms of the L levers, are weights to counterbalance
the weights of the gas holder, and both sides of the
gasholder are provided with these kind of levers,
which at the same time that they balance its weight
cause the ridge joint of the machine to rise and fall,
as before described, so that the under edges of the
gasholder, which are immersed in the water to
confine the gas, must move in an horizontal plane
instead of describing an arc of a circle as they would
do if the ridge joint was a fixed centre of motion.</p>

<p>When the gas holder is closed the perpendicular
arms of the levers stand nearly in a perpendicular
position, but when the gas holder is opened out the
levers become inclined. And as they move upon a
fixed fulcrum at their lower extremities, and are
jointed to the sides of the gas holder at their upper
extremities, they allow the whole of the gas holder<span class="pagenum" id="Page189">[189]</span>
to descend gradually upon the guide rods, nearly in
the same degree as the lower edges would rise up
if the ridge joint was stable, and if the sides described
an arc of a circle.</p>

<p>It is obvious, however, that the latter movement is
not very essential, but it is convenient and necessary
to make a very inconsiderable depth of water in the
trough or tank serve the purpose it is intended. It
may be also observed that the sides of the collapsing
gas holder may be made to unfold or open on a
fixed ridge point as a centre of motion, but it will
then require a considerable depth of water in the
tank to keep the lower edges of the sides and ends
of the machine always beneath the surface of the
water, because the sides of the gas holder then describe
an arc of a circle when they are open. Fig.
1, <a href="#PlateVII">plate VII.</a>, is a perspective view of the apparatus,
as it appears when partly filled with gas. Fig.
2, <a href="#PlateVI">plate VI.</a>, exhibits a perpendicular longitudinal
section made through the middle of the gas
holder and tank; fig. 3, <a href="#PlateVI">plate VI.</a>, represents a
transverse section; fig. 4, <a href="#PlateVI">plate VI.</a>, is an end view
of the machine, and fig. 5, exhibits an horizontal
plan or section of part of the gas holder, or one<span class="pagenum" id="Page190">[190]</span>
of its ends, to show how the end plates are jointed
together, and the leather applied to prevent the
escape of the gas.</p>

<p>A, fig. 2, is the inlet pipe which conveys the
gas into the machine, it rises up perpendicularly
through the water in the tank, high enough to
prevent the water entering it. B, is the exit
pipe for discharging the gas into the mains
from the gas holder. It rises up nearly to the top
of the machine. C, C, are the guide rods, they are
firmly fixed at their lower extremities into a cast-iron
framing D, D, beneath the bottom of the
tank. The upper ends of these rods are kept
steady by chains E, E, fig. 3, and fig. 4, descending
on each side of the gas holder, and fastened
at bottom to D, D, part of the same iron framing.
F, G, K, K, are the balance (or L) levers
which suspend or bear up the gas holders; they
move on fixed centre pins supported in pieces
<i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, fig. 2, and 3, of the framing D. The upper
end of the perpendicular arms are jointed to the
iron bars H, H, H, see fig. 2, which are riveted
to the side plates of the gas holder; they are
united by knuckle joints W, fig. 6, which allow<span class="pagenum" id="Page191">[191]</span>
the sides of the machine to approach each other
till they come together. The arms <i>i</i>, <i>i</i>, of the
bent levers F, G, K, K, fig. 4, are placed nearly at
right angles to the other arms F, G, fig. 3, and the
extremities of the arms <i>i</i>, <i>i</i>, are loaded with counterpoise
weights K, K, which always tend to
bring the arms F, G, into a vertical position, and
consequently to close up the sides of the gas
holder, in order to expel the gas through the exit
pipe B, fig. 2.</p>

<p>Three pairs of the above mentioned L levers are
represented in fig. 2, in the length of the gas holder
to support it in different parts and to prevent it
altering its figure. The weight that must be
used is according to the magnitude of the machine.
The pairs of levers F, G, K, K, fig. 3, are
placed side by side on the same centre pins,
and cross each other. K, K, are counterpoises at
the ends of the arms <i>i</i>, <i>i</i>, they are long pieces of
iron extending from one lever K, to the next
lever. The tank is furnished at the bottom
with a recess, as seen in fig. 3, and 4, to allow the
arms <i>i</i>, <i>i</i>, and counterpoises K, K, to descend
beneath the edges of the gas holder. In the<span class="pagenum" id="Page192">[192]</span>
course of the movement of the machine, the sides
of the gas holder are shorter at the top or ridge
joints than at the bottom edges, as seen in fig. 2,
in order that the under edges of the folding
ends can move in an horizontal plane. Each of
the folding ends is made of two triangular plates,
connected together by an air tight joint, and each
plate is again jointed to its respective side plate,
and they are made tight by introducing a piece of
leather or oil-cloth, or any other flexible substance
impervious to air in the angle at the joint.</p>

<p>Fig. 5, represents the end plates of the gas
holder when nearly extended, but when it is closed
up, the two parts N, O, of the end assume the
position as shewn by dotted lines. L, M, fig. 5,
shews how the ends of the two side plates are
turned outwards at <i>b</i>, to render them stiff and
firm. As all the flexible joints are made strong
by metallic joints or hinges, the leather has no
stress to bear but only to prevent the escape of the
gas; R, R, fig. 2, are the collars of leather to prevent
the escape of the gas at the openings in the
top or ridge joint where the guide rods <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, pass
through.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page193">[193]</span></p>

<p>The tank must be filled with water to such a
level that the under edges of the sides and ends
of the gas holder will be a few inches immersed
in the water. The counterpoises K, K, fig. 3,
tend to close the sides of the machine together,
and expel the gas from the gas holder through
the pipe B, fig. 2. The counterpoises are so adjusted
in weight as to force out the gas with the
requisite pressure.</p>

<p>If more gas be introduced by the pipe A, it distends
the sides of the machine and moves them
outwards upon the ridge joint. A man hole, as
seen at S, fig. 2, is made in each side of the gas
holder, to give entrance when any repairs are
necessary, or to oil or examine the joining leathers.
It is scarcely necessary to add that the form and
dimensions of this gas holder, and the materials
of which it can be made may be varied without any
deviation from its essential properties as they have
been now described. For instance, the ends of
the gas holder may be formed of more than two
folding plates, united together, if it is judged
necessary, and the levers F, G, may be varied in
number, form, or proportion, provided they balance<span class="pagenum" id="Page194">[194]</span>
the weight of the sides and cause the lower edges
of the gas holder to move nearly in an horizontal
plane. Or the balance levers may be laid aside entirely,
and the gas holder may be suspended from
the upper part of the guide rods C, C, without
moving up and down thereon. But in this case it
will require more water in the tank to keep the
open end of the gas holder always immersed in the
water; the weight of the sides of the gas holder
will then tend more to bring them together and to
expel the gas.</p>

<p>In proportion as the quantity of water sufficient
for the tank of the collapsing gas holder is less than
that required for the tanks of other gas holders, it is
attended with this further advantage, that the water
can be let off or removed without any expence when
repairs are necessary. If the repairs indeed are
trivial, they can be made without letting off the
water at all, the depth being no more than one
foot. In the case, on the contrary, of the gas
holder, with or without specific gravity apparatus,
the quantity of water is so considerable, that the
means provided for carrying it off must always be
attended with great difficulty and expence; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page195">[195]</span>
yet it is a provision which is in all cases indispensable,
no matter however difficult or expensive,
for no material repair to the interior of the apparatus
can be otherwise effected.</p>

<p>With regard to the best size of a gas holder
adapted to a certain number of retorts, it may be
stated, that this machine should be of a sufficient
capacity to hold the whole quantity of gas that is
required for the supply of the lights during one
night, exclusive of what may be furnished by the
retorts during that time.</p>

<h3><i>Rule for finding the capacity of a Collapsing
Gas Holder of given dimensions.</i></h3>

<p>The bulk of gas which a collapsing gas holder
of given dimensions will contain, may be found,
by multiplying the area of the triangle contained
between the side plates when at their greatest extent,
and the surface of the water, by the mean
length of the side plate. For example, suppose
the base of the triangular end plate be 30 feet long,<span class="pagenum" id="Page196">[196]</span>
and 30 feet high, and that the length of the side
plate at the top be 40 feet, and at the bottom 60 feet,</p>

<p class="example">30 × 15 = 450 area of end plate,<br />
450 × 50 = mean length of end plate,<br />
= 22,000 cubic feet capacity.<a id="FNanchor44"></a><a href="#Footnote44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote44"></a><a href="#FNanchor44"><span class="label">[44]</span></a>
A collapsing gas holder of 22,000 cubic feet capacity, costs about
£. 800, it weighs eight tons; a collapsing gas holder containing 15,000
cubic feet, which weighs seven tons, costs about £. 700, and a ditto
containing 30,000 cubic feet costs about £. 1000. The depth of the
cistern for either is one foot.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<h3><i>Reciprocating Safety Valve.</i></h3>

<p>It must be sufficiently obvious that when the
gas holder is full, and the distillation of the gas
continues going on, that unless a provision is made
for conveying away the surplus gas, it must escape
by bubbling up from underneath the gas holder.
And should the gas holder happen to be enclosed
within walls, the gas may by chance accumulate,
so as to give rise to serious accidents.</p>

<p>As a remedy for this evil the manufacturers of
coal gas have until very lately contented themselves
with what is called a <i>safety tube</i>, adapted to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page197">[197]</span>
gas holder, by which, all the superfluous gas was
carried away into the open air; or by leaving large
apertures in the roof or upper part of the building,
for the ready escape of the gas. By either of these
devices the danger from the accumulation of waste
gas, was in part only avoided, and instances might
be named where dangerous consequences ensued
from an accumulation of gas, in a confined atmosphere,
in the vicinity of the upper part of the
gas holder.</p>

<p>In some instances, indeed, recourse was had to the
establishment of a communication between all
the reservoirs and an auxiliary gas holder or gas
holders, by means of a pipe furnished with an
hydraulic valve; but this was an expensive arrangement
which required personal superintendance, and
depended, of course, for its efficiency on the integrity
and good conduct of the servant employed.</p>

<p>Mr. Clegg has now, however, invented what has
been termed the Reciprocating Safety Valve, which
has a self-acting operation, and by which an exit
for the surplus gas of any number of gas holders
that may be in action is provided to an unlimited
extent. A communication is established between<span class="pagenum" id="Page198">[198]</span>
all the gas holders and a waste pipe, which communication
opens or closes by the action of the gas,
as occasion requires, and which may be extended
to any number of gas holders at a trifling cost.</p>

<p>The apparatus has now been adopted at the
greater number of gas light establishments, and
has been uniformly found most efficient in its operation.
Fig. 9, <a href="#PlateVI">plate VI.</a>, presents a perpendicular
section of the apparatus; <i>h</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>h</i>, is a small
vessel made of sheet iron, about eighteen inches in
diameter, and twenty inches deep, closed at top
and open at bottom. It is inverted into an outer
air tight vessel, <i>i</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>i</i>, of double the height and
rather greater diameter, which is filled with water
to a certain height; D, is a pipe communicating
with the gas holders that are in action; this pipe
branches upwards through the bottom of the outer
vessel, <i>i</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>i</i>, and reaches a little above the surface
of the water in the outer vessel. E, is a small
pipe, the upper extremity of which is sealed by
means of an inverted sheet iron cup G, the edge of
which is submersed under the surface of the water
in the outer vessel, <i>i</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>i</i>. This pipe conveys
the waste gas into the upper part of any chimney.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page199">[199]</span></p>

<p>For let us suppose that the gas holders become
overcharged; the gas must then acquire an increased
density before the wooden curb of the gas holder
G, fig. 7, <a href="#PlateVI">plate VI.</a>,<a id="FNanchor45"></a><a href="#Footnote45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> at the lower extremity of
the overcharged gas holder can begin to rise out of
the water. But when the elasticity of the gas is
thus far increasing, and before the curb can wholly
emerge out of the water, the small vessel <i>h</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>h</i>,
of the reciprocating safety valve, ascends, and consequently
establishes a communication between the
overcharged gas holder and the pipe D, of the
reciprocating safety valve. The surplus gas thus
passes into the waste pipe E, E, which had been
before sealed by the inverted cup G, and is hence
conveyed into the upper part of the chimney
where it terminates, so that no accumulation of gas
can ever take place above, or in the vicinity of any
gas holder.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote45"></a><a href="#FNanchor45"><span class="label">[45]</span></a> Every gas holder ought to have a wooden curb at the bottom.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>It must be obvious on the other hand, that when
the gas in any of the gas holders has recovered its
original density, the reciprocating safety valve will
again be closed by the descending of the cup G.</p>

<h3><i>Gas Metre, or Self-acting Guage, which
measures and registers, in the absence of the
observer, the quantity of Gas produced in a
given time, from any given quantity of coal,
or consumed during a given period, by any
number of burners or lamps.</i></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="largecap">F</span>or the invention of this machine we are indebted
to the ingenuity and talents of Mr. Clegg, and
undoubtedly, of all the improvements with which
the new art of procuring light has been recently
enriched, there is none which has been attended
with results more beneficial to the interest both
of the manufacturer and consumer of coal gas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page201">[201]</span></p>

<p>In this machine we see combined a standard
or check on the conduct of the workmen, which
enables the manufacturer of coal gas to assure himself
of obtaining at all times the greatest possible
produce from his establishment; a measure by
which he can deal the gas out to his customers in
whatever quantities they may require it, and an
index which registers the exact quantities furnished,
and thus serves as an infallible account of debtor and
creditor between the seller and purchaser of gas.</p>

<p>This machine, therefore, performs at once all the
duties of an overseer, meter, and book-keeper, and
performs them all so much more effectually, that its
operation is not dependant on matters so uncertain
as the care or integrity of servants, but on unerring
principles which are fixed and incapable of any
hidden misapplication.</p>

<p>The view in which this machine naturally demands
our particular attention is that in which as
a standard of the work which ought to be performed,
it enables the manufacturer to make sure of
obtaining the greatest possible produce from his
establishment.</p>

<p>The gas metre serves this purpose in the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page202">[202]</span>
place by enabling the proprietors of gas works to
know what is the utmost possible quantity of gas
which can economically be obtained from any
given portion of coal, with a given portion of
fuel, in any given time.</p>

<p>It is necessary, in every gas light establishment,
in order to know whether as much gas is obtained
as might and ought to be produced, that it be previously
ascertained by a series of experiments
how much gas the species of coal used at the works
is capable, on an average, of producing, and such
data it is obvious, can only be obtained by means of
an apparatus, which, like this gas metre, shall take
measure of the quantities of gas supplied by the manufactory
at all times, and under all circumstances.</p>

<p>It may, perhaps, be imagined, that assays sufficient
for that purpose might be made by means of a
few retorts, or small experimental apparatus, or by
noting down the quantity of gas produced at the
works during the time the valves which convey the
gas into the street mains are shut, and during which
time the capacity of the gas holders may afford a
rule for ascertaining the quantity produced. But
nothing can be further from the truth; assays of<span class="pagenum" id="Page203">[203]</span>
this description to be practically useful and to serve
as a basis for the operations of a large establishment,
must be made on a scale of magnitude and
be continued for a considerable period of time as
well as under every variety of circumstances.</p>

<p>The quantity of gas obtained from any given
quantity of coal, varies so much with the degree of
heat applied, and the circumstances under which
the decomposition of the coal is effected, that the
solitary product of any one period of time can
afford no positive criterion for the product of
any other period. A correct general conclusion,
in short, can only be drawn from the result of
experiments carried on uninterruptedly through
a succession of days and nights, and such a continuity
of experiments could, previous to the invention
of the gas metre, only be affected by means
of two separate gas holders, one for measuring
the gas as it is produced, and the other for receiving
the gas after it is thus measured, in order
to its being transferred into the mains. By the
aid of a single gas holder, an admeasurement could
obviously be effected only during the time the valves
which transmit the gas into the street mains are<span class="pagenum" id="Page204">[204]</span>
shut, and this, when the days are short, as in the
winter season, the most productive period of the
whole year, is only about eight hours out of
the twenty-four, leaving nearly two-thirds of each
day, during which, no account could be taken of
the quantity of gas produced at the works.</p>

<p>It deserves further to be observed, that when two
gas holders are employed, the utmost that can be
effected by them, is the admeasurement of the gas
produced, while the distinguishing feature of the
metre is, that it not only measures, but by its own
action registers the quantity of gas produced, or
expended, in any given time.</p>

<p>Nor does the whole merit of this machine, in an
economical point of view, consist in its thus furnishing
the manufacturer with an infallible criterion
of the quantity of gas which ought at all times
to be produced; for, in the second place, it enables
him by the several experiments which have supplied
that criterion, to ascertain at what least possible
expenditure of fuel, and in what space of time the
greatest possible quantity of gas can be produced.</p>

<p>The advantage of the gas metre, in these additional
respects, will be sufficiently demonstrated<span class="pagenum" id="Page205">[205]</span>
by attending for a moment to the situation of the
manufacturer of coal gas, when without any such
protecting register. Suppose, for example, that
the manufacturer desires to know whether his
workmen have made during a given time, (say
during the night), the quantity of gas which
they ought to have produced from a given quantity
of coal, or whether they have consumed no
greater proportion of fuel for its production
than was absolutely necessary. He may, upon
examination, find all the retorts in an excellent
working state, but whether they have been so
during the whole of the night, or whether the
requisite quantity of gas has been really produced
during the time that the valves which convey
the gas into the mains have been open, is to him
a matter of uncertainty. The workman may, as
has been too often the case, have neglected the fire
during the night, and on every such occasion,
in order to bring back again the retorts to a
proper working state, as well as to redeem the
time lost, he may have urged the heat to a degree
of intensity much exceeding the temperature best
suited for the most economical production of<span class="pagenum" id="Page206">[206]</span>
the gas. And however injurious such irregular
modes of operating may be for the master’s interest
they are altogether shrouded from his observation.
It deserves also to be noticed that the
loss occasioned by this irregularity of operating
is not merely a loss of fuel, for in consequence of
it the retorts, (particularly if cast-iron retorts of the
usual forms,) are liable to more injury in one day
than they would be during a whole week, if properly
attended.</p>

<p>When the proprietor of the establishment, on
the contrary, has recourse to the gas metre, not
one of all these evils can occur without being
liable to certain and instant detection. From
the data which preceding experiments on the productiveness
of the species of coal used at the establishment
have furnished, the overseer of the works
is always enabled to determine, from the portion
of coal he finds used, how much gas ought to have
been manufactured during any space of time that
has elapsed, and also the portion of carbonizing
fuel which was necessary for the production of
that quantity of gas; and comparing these data
with the quantity of gas which the index of the gas<span class="pagenum" id="Page207">[207]</span>
metre announces has been produced, he is enabled
to determine by mere inspection, in an unerring
manner, whether the workman has acted with
that sedulous attention to his duty which the
economy of the establishment demands.</p>

<p>The many important advantages in short which
the manufacturer of coal gas derives from this
machine, considered <i>as a standard or check on
the conduct of the workmen</i>, may be summed up
in this&mdash;that while, without the aid of the gas
metre, no establishment can be possibly more exposed
to suffer from the ignorance of managers or
the want of fidelity in servants, than a gas manufactory,
there is none which is more independent
of either than a gas manufactory, possessed of this
important apparatus. Nor can the amount of that
possible loss be regarded as otherwise than extremely
serious, when attention is paid to the
difference in profit and loss between conducting
the process of manufacturing coal gas on a system
founded on the deductions of experience, and an
assiduous attention to keeping up a regularly sustained
temperature; and conducting the process
on a system of random calculation and irregular<span class="pagenum" id="Page208">[208]</span>
working,&mdash;a difference, which as appears from the
details already laid before the reader, amounts in
respect to the quantity of gas produced, to from fifty
to one hundred per cent.; in respect to the waste of
machinery, to upwards of eighty per cent.; and in
respect to the consumption of fuel and time to a
sum in the ratio of the loss experienced under both
these other heads.</p>

<p>The Second General Point of View in which the
gas metre claims our attention, is, its excellence as
a standard of fair dealing between the seller and
consumer of gas, by enabling the former to supply
the gas in whatever quantities it may be required,
and serving, at the same time, as a self-acting register
of the quantities furnished. It is for this
purpose merely necessary to connect the gas metre
with the pipe of supply, which conveys the gas to
any burner, or number of burners, or lamps, and
the index of the instrument will regularly announce
the precise quantity of gas which has passed through
the machine during any period of time, from one
day to a number of years, without requiring any
particular sort of care whatever. Every person
must have noticed how shamefully many individuals<span class="pagenum" id="Page209">[209]</span>
disregard the terms on which they have contracted
for a supply of gas, some by means of the
excessive flame they keep up, and others suffering
the lights to burn hours beyond the time stipulated
and contracted with the gas light company which
supplies them. The latter have officers, it is true,
whose duty it is to check such abuses as far as is
in their power, but having no right of access to the
premises of individuals, their vigilance can only
extend to shops and places open to public view
and of general access; and to these, of course,
but occasionally. In short in every place where
gas is supplied on contracts to pay for burning it
a limited time, by means of certain sized burners
or lamps, instead of according to the quantity
actually furnished, the seller must always be in a
greater or less degree, and in some cases wholly
dependent on the care and honesty of the purchaser
for the protection of his commodity from
waste and depredation. But when on the contrary
the seller possesses, as he now does, by means of
the gas metre, an infallible check of the exact
quantity of gas consumed in a certain time, and
the purchaser is bound to pay for as much as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page210">[210]</span>
uses, the former is relieved from every apprehension
or chance of being defrauded, and the latter is
furnished with the same motives for economizing
gas as he would have for economizing oil and
candles.</p>

<p>The manufacturer is certain of obtaining what
he has a just right to, value for the whole quantity
of gas supplied, and the consumer is assured that
if he wastes the gas unnecessarily, he must as he
ought, pay the price of his own carelessness or
profusion. Equal justice is done both to the consumer
and seller, and the public at large are at the
same time most materially benefited, in as much
as they are saved from paying for the expence of
that waste of gas by a few, which from the former
impossibility of tracing it to the offending parties,
was necessarily added to the whole cost of the gas,
and equally partitioned upon all the individuals
who made use of it. The waste being now transferred
to those who occasioning the waste and ought
alone in justice to bear it, the price of the gas
to the equitable and honest consumer, is thus reduced
to an equitable and correct measure of value.</p>

<p>The benefits of this invention have a yet wider<span class="pagenum" id="Page211">[211]</span>
range; not only does it secure full value for the
whole of the gas manufactured, but it tends to
make the gas a greatly more marketable article.
For in the system of charging for the supply of
gas by the year, half year, or quarter, and at one
common rate, many individuals who are only
occasionally in want of gas lights, or whose demand
is irregular and uncertain, such as the
proprietors of public rooms, theatres, &amp;c. are
debarred of availing themselves of this kind of
illumination, except at an expence quite disproportioned
to what other more regular customers pay,
and out of all proportion of the value of the quantity
of gas consumed by them. The gas light
under such circumstances is not as it ought to be,
a light for all. It is not as oil and candle are, a
benefit which every one may obtain who is in
need of it, and in such quantities as may best suit
his means and convenience. One of the capital
advantages, of the gas metre, however, is, that it
makes gas a substitute for oil and candles, applicable
under all circumstances, and that it enables
the manufacturer without the least prejudice or
chance of prejudice to his interest, to supply gas<span class="pagenum" id="Page212">[212]</span>
in whatever quantities it may be demanded, and
at a fair proportioned price.</p>

<p>In speaking thus of the influence which the gas
metre must have in attending the beneficial application
of the new lights, we are not unaware that
situations may present itself where the action of
the metre might be impeded from the want of a
sufficient pressure of the gas in the pipe of supply
connected with it. But this can never be the case
except where the pressure of the gas in the pipe of
supply is so low as three-eighths of an inch of a
column of water, and in all such cases it is only
necessary to give a greater capacity to the wheel of
the machine, than would be necessary under other
circumstances, and this will at once make up for
the inferiority of pressure. In point of fact, therefore,
no situation can occur, where the application
of the machine may not be rendered available.<a id="FNanchor46"></a><a href="#Footnote46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>Nor do the various advantages which have now
been detailed, form all the good that this important
machine is capable of furnishing. The gas metre
furnishes at its axis a power which has been ingeniously<span class="pagenum" id="Page213">[213]</span>
applied to put in motion the shaft of the
lime machine, employed for purifying the gas, see
fig. 3, <a href="#PlateVII">plate VII.</a><a id="FNanchor47"></a><a href="#Footnote47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
The importance of a power
thus certain in its operation, and obtained free of
expence, must at once be obvious, when it is
considered that upon whatever plan the purifying
apparatus or lime machine may be constructed,
it is absolutely essential, that its contents be kept
constantly in motion, in order to produce the
desired effect upon the crude gas, which would
otherwise pass away in an impure state.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote47"></a><a href="#FNanchor47"><span class="label">[47]</span></a>
The upper axis communicates with the agitating shaft of the
lime machine, and the lower axis is a continuation of the shaft of the
gas metre. The two pullies are connected by a strap.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>When the charge of keeping the agitating shaft
of the lime machine in action, is intrusted to a
workman, there is no positive security against his
occasionally neglecting his duty, whereas by applying
the gas metre to that purpose, the manufacturer
is assured beyond the possibility of deception,
that when gas is produced, that gas is as certainly
purified, and a saving is effected in point
of labour of the expence of two men, one during
the day, and one during the night.</p>

<h3><i>Description of the Gas Metre at the Royal
Mint Gas Works.</i></h3>

<p>Fig. 4, <a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a>, represents a perpendicular
section of the gas metre. It is placed between the
purifying apparatus or lime machine, and the gas
holder fig. 8, <a href="#PlateIII">plate III.</a>, exhibits a front elevation;
fig. 1, <a href="#PlateIII">plate III.</a>, a perspective view, and fig. 6,
<a href="#PlateIII">plate III.</a>, a transverse section of the machine.</p>

<p>It consists of a hollow wheel or cylinder, made
of thin iron plate, revolving upon an horizontal
axis, in the manner of a grindstone; this wheel is
enclosed in a cast iron air tight case containing
water.</p>

<p>The cylinder or wheel, is composed of two
circular channels, 1 and 2, fig. 4, <a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a>, concentric
to each other. The larger or outer channel
1, is divided into three equal compartments,
by partition plates, marked <i>a</i>, as shewn in the
design. The compartments are provided with
hydraulic ducts or valves, made at the upper part
of every partition plate <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, and by means<span class="pagenum" id="Page215">[215]</span>
of them a communication is formed between the
larger concentric channel 1, and the outer case in
which the wheel revolves.</p>

<p>Similar valves are also placed at the foot of each
partition plate, they are seen near the letters <i>a</i>,
<i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, and by this means, a communication is established,
between each compartment or chamber of
the larger concentric channel 1, and the smaller
interior circle 2, of the wheel.</p>

<p>On inspecting the design, it will be seen that
the valves are situated in opposite directions to
each other, hence there can be no communication
either between the inner smaller concentric channel
2, and the larger compartment of the wheel 1,
nor between the latter compartment, and the exterior
case, in which the wheel revolves, except,
through the valves <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, which form the communicating
ducts. It will be seen also, that
these valves are carried from one chamber of the
machine into another, but in opposite directions;
the entry into one chamber, being in the opposite
direction to the hydraulic duct, placed in the other
chamber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page216">[216]</span></p>

<p>From these particulars the action of the machine
will be obvious.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that the outer case (which is
marked in the sketch by a black tint,) in which
the wheel revolves, be filled with water, to about
an inch above the axis of the wheel, and that gas is
conveyed into the interior small channel, by a pipe,
passing along the axis, so as to allow the wheel to
turn freely round, and that the pipe is turned up
at right angles in the inner chamber, and projects
a little way above the surface of the water, as
shewn in the design. The gas then must enter
into the interior chamber of the wheel above the
surface of the water, and must press against the
adjacent partition; it will therefore cause the
wheel to turn round, and in consequence of this
motion, the next partition plate will press the gas
against the surface of the water, and cause it to
pass through the hydraulic opening, in an equal
quantity to that, which is introduced into the
exterior chamber.</p>

<p>This alternate filling, and discharging, of the
contents of each chamber, will take place once<span class="pagenum" id="Page217">[217]</span>
during every revolution of the wheel, and hence
the number of times each particular chamber has
been filled, and emptied of gas, may be known.</p>

<p>In fact this machine performs the office of three
revolving gas holders, fixed on an horizontal axis,
and moving in a cistern, which is the outer case of
the machine. One gas holder, or one compartment of
the machine, is always in the act of becoming filled
with gas, another is emptying its contents into the
outer case, from which it passes into the reservoir,
where it is to be stored up, or to the lamps, where
it is to be burned, and the third compartment is stationary,
or in an equilibrium. The wheel in any
situation will therefore always have one of its receiving,
and one of its discharging valves open, and
consequently it will revolve.</p>

<p>Now to ascertain the quantity of gas discharged
by one revolution of the wheel, we need only to know
the capacity of the chambers, and add them together.
Let us for example suppose, that each chamber
contains 576 cubic inches, then one revolution
of the wheel, discharges a cubic foot of gas. To
register the total number of revolutions which
the wheel makes in a certain time, a train of wheel-work<span class="pagenum" id="Page218">[218]</span>
is connected with the axis of the metre, see
fig. 8, <a href="#PlateIII">plate III.</a>; it consists of a pinion impelling a
common train of wheel-work, composed of any
number of wheels. The pinion on the axis of one
wheel, acts into the circumference of the next wheel,
and the circumference of the wheel being as ten
to one, it is obvious whilst the metre makes
100,000 revolutions, if the series consists of six
wheels, the last wheel of the series, will only have
made one revolution. Each axis of the wheels is
provided with a finger and dial plate, divided into
ten parts, therefore any number of revolutions may
be read off at any time by inspection betwixt
10,000,000 and one.</p>

<p>The velocity with which the metre acts, is of
course in proportion to the quantity of gas passing
through it. Thus suppose there is a burner or gas
lamp connected with the machine, of one foot capacity
lighted, which consumes four cubic feet of gas
in an hour, the gas metre performs four revolutions
per hour, and so on for every number of burners or
lamps, not exceeding the number which the machine
is calculated to supply.</p>

<p>To render the construction of the gas metre<span class="pagenum" id="Page219">[219]</span>
more obvious, we have at fig. 6, <a href="#PlateIII">plate III.</a>, exhibited
a transverse section of the machine; <i>a</i>, is the
outer case of the machine in which the wheel revolves.
B, B, the outer or larger concentric chamber,
(marked 1, in fig. 4, <a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a>) L, the inner or
smaller concentric chamber, (marked 2, in fig. 4,
<a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a>) <i>d</i>, the index on the axis which passes
through a stuffing box in front of the machine. 5, 5, 5,
5, are stays or braces for supporting the wheel; they
are likewise seen in fig. 4, <a href="#PlateII">plate II.</a> A, is the inlet
pipe for the gas to enter into the machine. The
gas passes through the pipe <i>h</i>, and from thence into
the curved pipe <i>i</i>, into the interior chamber L, of
the metre. The pipe <i>h</i>, is surrounded by a second
pipe K, which has a small aperture at <i>x</i>, the office of
which is, to act as a siphon, in order to preserve the
proper level of the water in the machine. The
water is poured into the machine, through the small
funnel at the back of the entrance pipe A. <i>y</i>, is a
float, which stops the performance of the metre
altogether, if a fraudulent attempt should be made,
to stop the registering of the metre, by drawing off
the water with which it is charged. In fig. 1,
<a href="#PlateIII">plate III.</a>, <i>a</i>, is the inlet pipe; <i>b</i>, the outlet pipe<span class="pagenum" id="Page220">[220]</span>
of the gas; and fig. 2, shows the interior chamber.</p>

<p>The registering wheel work, may be adapted to
any part of the machine, and the motion may be
communicated by a mitre wheel, from the shaft
of the machine to the index.</p>

<p>The gas metre at the Royal Mint measures

<h3><i>Rule for calculating the weight, which a Gas
Metre of given dimensions, will raise to a
given height, in a given time.</i></h3>

<p>The following calculation will exemplify the
power produced by a gas metre constructed to
register 60,000 cubic feet of gas, in a day. The
diameter of such a metre would be six feet, its
depth three feet, and the depth of its rim eighteen
inches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page221">[221]</span></p>

<p>The section of the rim would therefore contain
648 square inches, and supposing the pressure of
the gas passing into the machine to be equal to
a column of water two inches high, its buoyant
power would then be equal to 1296 cubic inches
of water, or forty pounds and a half weight. The
mean diameter of the metre is 4 feet 6 inches, which
multiplied by three, gives the perpendicular height
that forty pounds and a half weight, would be raised
by each revolution of the metre. The number of
revolutions, in one hour which the metre makes, is
40, they would raise forty pounds and a half, 540
feet high in one hour.</p>

<p>Such a power is more therefore than sufficient to
keep in motion the shaft of the lime machine.</p>

<h3><i>Gas Holder Valve,&mdash;Siphon, or Water
Reservoir.</i></h3>

<p>This name is given to the principal hydraulic
valve, by means of which a communication is
established between the gas holder or gas holders,
and the principal pipe, leading to the mains.</p>

<p>Fig. 7, <a href="#PlateIII">plate III.</a>, exhibits a section of this valve.<span class="pagenum" id="Page222">[222]</span>
It is composed of an air tight box, A, A, A, A, containing
a portion of tar, or water; <i>d</i>, is the inlet
pipe which communicates with the gas holder,
B the outlet pipe; which conveys the gas into the
mains. C, C, is an inverted cup, furnished with a
sliding rod, passing through a stuffing box, so that
by means of the rod, the cup may be raised or
depressed. For it is obvious that a communication
will be established between the inlet pipe <i>d</i>, and
the outlet <i>B</i>, when the cup is raised above the
surface of the tar or water in the box A; and that
the communication will be cut off when the cup
is depressed into the tar. In the latter position the
cup is shewn in the design. The sliding rod which
raises and depresses the cup, passes through a
frame E, E, affixed to the upper part of the box
A, and which serves as a guard for the rod, so that
it may be locked by means of a cutter passing
through the sliding rod, and the frame of the box.</p>

<p>Fig. 3, <a href="#PlateIII">plate III.</a>, exhibits a similar valve, which
at the same time may be used as a <i>water reservoir</i>,
commonly called a <i>siphon</i>, for collecting the water
that may happen to accumulate in the mains,
a provision which it is essential should be made<span class="pagenum" id="Page223">[223]</span>
at the lowest place, where two or more pipes incline
towards each other. For it is obvious, that
if a fluid should happen to accumulate in the
angular part, where two descending pipes meet, to a
height sufficient to fill the angular point, the communication
between the two pipes would be completely
cut off, so that the gas could not pass. <i>x</i>, <i>x</i>,
<i>x</i>, <i>x</i>, fig. 3, is the reservoir; A, the inlet pipe; B,
the outlet pipe; <i>b</i>, a short cylinder communicating
with the exit pipe B, it is open at bottom and
closed at top. D, <i>d</i>, the hydraulic cup which,
when raised by means of the spindle <i>e</i>, closes the
exit pipe B, by the open end of the cylinder <i>b</i>,
becoming immersed in the tar or water contained
in the cup D, <i>d</i>. The darts show the course of the
gas when the valve is open: <i>f</i> is a small pipe furnished
at top with a screw and covered with a
cap; by attaching a hand pump to this pipe, the
superfluous portion of fluid that may have accumulated
in the reservoir, may be removed. <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>,
is the <i>equilibrium</i> pipe, it connects the exit pipe B
with the inlet pipe A, when the stop-cock with
which it is furnished is opened. This pipe prevents
the tar or water from being blown out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page224">[224]</span>
hydraulic valves that may be interposed between
the different descending mains of a district, as
would otherwise happen, in consequence of the
sudden concussion that takes place when the main
or gas holder valves are opened. Because the gas in
the mains, and the gas in the gas holders, are not
in equilibrium. But by means of the small pipe
<i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, the equilibrium is obtained when the stop-cock
of the pipe <i>c</i>, <i>c</i>, is opened, and this should
always be done before the main or gas holder
valves are opened. For by neglecting this condition,
the water or tar is liable to be blown out of
all the hydraulic valves, that may happen to be
interposed in the system of the pipes for conveying
the gas, and communications are thus
opened, which were intended to be shut.</p>

<h3><i>Governor or Regulating Guage.</i></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="largecap">T</span>he governor or regulating guage, the construction
of which has already been detailed, <a href="#Page171">page
171</a>, we shall here consider as an instrument by
means of which the gas flames of lamps and burners
are kept of one steady and uniform magnitude.</p>

<p>The velocity of the gas in the mains and pipes
of supply, is in the first instance as various as there
are differences in the altitude and extent of the
mains and pipes of supply. A main, at one place
will furnish with a certain pressure of gas, a flame
one inch high, while at a different altitude it will
furnish a flame double that height.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page226">[226]</span></p>

<p>If again the direction of the pipe has many
turns or angles, and contractions, the velocity of
the gas will be different on that account, than if
it were direct and uniform. And if the pipe is
of any great length, and of an uniform bore, but
unequally furnished with veins or branch pipes
at certain parts, the burners will be very unequally
supplied with gas, those which are near its head
will be supplied with a fuller stream of gas, than
those which are situated towards its termination.</p>

<p>And independent of these differences thus arising
from diversity of local positions, there will always
be one grand variety in the velocity of the gas,
occasioned by the variety of periods during which
lights are required by different individuals supplied
from the same main or system of pipes, as
for example: when a certain number of burners are
to be supplied, and it happens that one half of
these burners are shut sooner than the rest, then
in consequence of this, the velocity of the gas in
the mains will be materially altered.</p>

<p>The inequality thus occasioned, may be seen
particularly exemplified in the case of houses
situated in the vicinity of any large establishment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page227">[227]</span>
such as either of the great theatres of the metropolis,
and supplied with gas from the same mains.
While the theatres are open, the lights in the adjacent
houses are low and feeble, often too much so
for the necessary purposes of the consumer, but
the moment the theatres are shut, the great quantity
of gas which they previously carried off, being
transferred to such of the private houses as continue
to be lighted, the gas flames at the latter are
raised to an extravagant height, and burn with an
intensity which makes the gas light partake more
of the character of a nuisance than of a benefit.</p>

<p>It may be necessary for the better appreciation of
the extent of this nuisance to observe, that it does
not arise merely from the excess of light produced,
but from the imperfect combustion of the gas, and
hence a disagreeable odour is produced. When the
flame is suffered to rise beyond the standard height,
the combustion of the gas becomes imperfect, part
of the gas passes through the flame unburnt, and
occasions the source of the offensive odour alluded
to, which the gas lights never produce when the
combustion of the gas is complete. The remedy
for all these inconveniences thus resulting from<span class="pagenum" id="Page228">[228]</span>
the various degrees of velocity of the gas in the
mains, is to be found in the instrument now under
description.</p>

<p>The effect of this machine, as already mentioned,
is, that it causes the gas to issue from the aperture
of the burners or lamps with one uniform velocity,
whatever may be the variations which take place
in the pressure which urges the gas to pass through
the pipes of supply. And such is the efficiency of
the operation of the machine, that it regulates the
flow of the gas through any burner, tube, or opening,
with a greater degree of exactness, than the
centrifugal apparatus, regulates the action of the
steam engine.</p>

<p>The construction of the regulator to effect this
purpose is precisely similar to the apparatus
already described, <a href="#Page171">page 171</a>. When applied for regulating
the magnitude of the gas flames, it is of
course usually made much smaller, of iron plates,
japanned within and without. Fig. 4, <a href="#PlateIII">plate III.</a>, exhibits
a perspective view of the machine; <i>a</i>, is the
inlet pipe, <i>b</i>, the outlet pipe; P, is the regulating
cone, passing through the regulating aperture <i>x</i>, T.
The floating vessel <i>u</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, receives the gas introduced<span class="pagenum" id="Page229">[229]</span>
into the machine; A, B, C, D, is the outer
air tight case of the regulator.</p>

<h3><i>Directions to Workmen for fixing the Governor
and Gas Metre.</i><a id="FNanchor49"></a><a href="#Footnote49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote49"></a><a href="#FNanchor49"><span class="label">[49]</span></a> Copied from Messrs. Clegg’s and Crossley’s printed directions to
workmen, for fixing governors and gas metres.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The governor must be fixed perpendicularly,
so as to admit its floating vessel <i>u</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>. Fig. 4,
<a href="#PlateIII">plate III.</a>, or fig. 9, <a href="#PlateIII">plate III.</a>, to be taken out of
the outer case of the machine if occasion should
require it.</p>

<p>The gas enters into the machine from the street
mains at the lowest branch <i>a</i>, and passes out of the
machine by its highest branch <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>In connecting the pipes of supply, particular
care must be taken that the work is not <i>bound</i>, or
the governor by any means rendered leaky. It
must be filled with water to the top of the central
tube.</p>

<p>Examine the workmanship of the machine to
see that it is perfect, and that the regulating cone<span class="pagenum" id="Page230">[230]</span>
P, is firmly secured to the top of the floating vessel
and well centered. The floating vessels <i>u</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>,
should clear the sides of the outer case of the apparatus
by a quarter of an inch; and when sunk
down, it should rest even upon the top of the central
pipe, which conducts the gas into, and out of, the
machine. The aperture in which the cone moves
will then be at its widest opening, and when the
floating vessel <i>u</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, has risen to its highest
elevation, the regulating aperture <i>x</i>, T, will be
closed.</p>

<p>In this situation particular attention must be
paid, that the regulating cone does not stick or
rub in any part, but that it descends freely.</p>

<p>To the lower extremity of the floating vessel
<i>u</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, may be adapted an air vessel for the purpose
of reducing the pressure of the gas.</p>

<p>The governor must be so fixed, that the water
which may condense in the pipes leading to the
burners shall drain back to the street mains, in
order that it may not accumulate in the machine
so as to impede its operations; for this purpose
the gas pipes should have a fall of half an inch in
three or four feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page231">[231]</span></p>

<p>When the locality of situation will not admit of
the water that may accumulate in the pipes falling
back to the mains, its accumulation within the
governor above the proper level of the water is
prevented by an inverted siphon affixed to the
machine, which allows the water to drain off without
any escape of the gas.</p>

<p>The governor must be firmly fixed to the nearest
beam or wall, as the least vibration will render the
lights connected with it unsteady.</p>

<p>When a situation cannot be obtained sufficiently
warm to prevent the water from freezing, the machine
must then be wrapped round with woollen
cloth, or any other bad conductor of heat. The
cellar where the gas enters the house, has generally
been found the most convenient situation.</p>

<p>For supplying any deficiency of water which the
governor may require; a small funnel with a
curved tube is placed for this purpose at the top
of the governor. When the governor is filled to
its proper height, the water will begin to run out
of the siphon.</p>

<p>The mode of regulating the height of the flames
will be stated presently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page232">[232]</span></p>

<p>Fig. 11, <a href="#PlateIII">plate III.</a>, exhibits a portable governor
or regulating guage, combined with a gas metre
in one case. A, is the inlet pipe which conveys the
gas into the machine, and B, is the pipe leading
from the governor to the lamps or burners. D, a
label expressing the quantity of gas discharged by
one revolution of the wheel, and the number of
lights which the metre is capable of supplying
when the pressure of the gas in the inlet pipe is of
a density sufficient to support a column of water of
half an inch in height.</p>

<p>In those situations where the pressure of the gas
is equal in density to support only a column of
water one-quarter of an inch in height, a metre of
a larger capacity must be adopted for supplying the
same number of lights; and if the pressure of the
gas be equal only to support a column of water
one-eighth of an inch in height, the capacity of the
metre must be still larger, and thus the capacity
may be increased so as to equal every pressure
that may occur. The index which registers the
number of revolutions, and consequently the quantity
of gas which passes through the metre, is shut
up in the projecting case, near H, furnished with
a lock and key.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page233">[233]</span></p>

<p>Previously to the gas metre being filled with
water, ascertain that the regulating cone is screwed
perfectly air tight into the top of the floating vessel
which receives the gas, and that the regulating
aperture in which the cone moves, together with
its spindle and guide rods, work perfectly free and
without friction. Raise the floating vessel to its
highest elevation, thereby closing the regulating
aperture suddenly with the cone; in this situation
it must not rub when turned and tried on every
side, but descend with the least friction.</p>

<p>The gas metre and regulator being thus examined
and fixed, the machine may be supplied
with the requisite quantity of water in the following
manner:</p>

<p>Open the stop-cock which admits the gas into
the machine; open also the aperture E, which
serves to show the pressure of the gas in the
machine, and likewise the opening G, which lets
out the air whilst water is poured in at the aperture
H. The superfluous quantity of water will run out
by the siphon tube at K.</p>

<p>Pour water also into the governor until it runs
out at the aperture at M; and when this has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page234">[234]</span>
accomplished, till the gas metre with water at the
opening H, until it overflows at the aperture K,
when the surface of the water will appear at the
cypher line on the scale board. The apertures F, G,
H, K, and M, may then be closed, and the machine
is ready for action.</p>

<p>Near to N, is an aperture communicating with
the stuffing box in which the axis of the machine
moves, and through which it should occasionally
be supplied with a small portion of melted tallow.</p>

<p>To adjust the height of the gas flames of the
burners, so that they be all uniform, open the
stop-cock which admits the gas into the metre, and
open also the stop-cocks of the burners, and as soon
as the air has become discharged by means of one or
two revolutions of the metre, light all the burners.
Adjust the height of the flames in the first instance
by their stop-cocks, that they become all of
an equal height, which should be about double
the diameter of the flame; if any of the flames be
too low when the stop-cock is fully open, a small
weight must be placed upon the top of the floating
vessel of the regulator, sufficient to produce the
required flame at the burner, and then again adjust<span class="pagenum" id="Page235">[235]</span>
the remaining lights by their stop-cocks as before
stated; this being done, the aperture to which
each burner is screwed must be sufficiently narrowed,
that it will admit no more gas than is
requisite for the required height of the flame,
when the stop-cock is fully open. The diminution
of the aperture of the stop-cock may be effected by
a brass plug fitted into it, with a hole in its centre,
which must be gradually widened with a drill
until the flame has required the proper height.
It is recommended, instead of adding weight to the
floating vessel of the regulator, that the tubes
which supply the gas be sufficiently capacious to
render the weight unnecessary.</p>

<p>The burners should also be examined from time
to time. Observe that the plugs, sockets, and every
other part of the gas metre and regulator be air
tight, and that there be no escape of water or gas.</p>

<p>An escape of gas, either from the metre or from
any of the tubes or burners, will be discovered by
looking at the index of the metre, as the wheel
cannot fail to move whenever there is an escape of
gas, if the stop-cock is open which supplies the
gas to the metre. The place where the gas escapes<span class="pagenum" id="Page236">[236]</span>
will be found in the usual way, either by the odour
which the gas produces, or by passing a lighted
taper over the apertures and connections of the
metre, and along the tubes leading to the burners,
which will cause the gas to take fire at the place
where the leak happens to be.</p>

<p>The following remarks will assist the workmen
in correcting any irregularities which may occur in
the lights connected with the apparatus.</p>

<p>A diminution, or extinction of the lights, may
be occasioned by a deficiency of water in the gas
metre or regulator; when this occurs the necessary
quantity of water must be supplied as before
directed up to the cypher line on the scale board
E, of the metre, and opening the aperture M,
where it may be seen when the water has risen to
the proper height in the governor.</p>

<p>A diminution of light may also be occasioned
by some obstruction or contraction of the tubes
which supply the gas, or by a diminution of the
pressure of the gas in the mains, to which the metre
was originally adjusted.</p>

<p>When the lights increase above their standard
height, and are variable with the changes in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page237">[237]</span>
pressure or velocity of the gas in the mains or
tubes of supply within the house or place, lighted,
there is then reason to believe that the governor
is not performing, which may arise from the following
causes. Its floating vessel <i>u</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, may
have become fast by the friction of the spindle or
guide rod, requiring cleaning, or by an accumulation
of water in the air-vessel of the floating
vessel <i>u</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>. The water may be drained off at
a small plug by taking out the floating vessel. The
same inconvenience would arise from a diminution
in the proper level of the water.</p>

<p>In order to ascertain that the governor performs
correctly, observe at the time of lighting or extinguishing
any of the burners connected with it,
that its floating vessel rises and falls every time the
stop-cock is opened, and that the lights do not
suffer any material change.</p>

<p>An instantaneous starting or dancing of the
lights, is generally occasioned by an accumulation
of water in the tubes through which the gas
passes; if this should happen in the vicinity of the
metre and governor, it may be drained off at the
aperture K. A provision for a like purpose is also<span class="pagenum" id="Page238">[238]</span>
made at the bottom of the governor when detached
from the metre.</p>

<p>In order at any time to ascertain the pressure of
the gas in the metre, close the stop-cock which
admits the gas, and open the aperture G and F,
which will shew the level of the water on the scale
board E. This being first observed, close the
aperture G, and open the stop-cock, and the pressure
of the gas in the metre will be indicated by
the rise of the water on the scale board E, above
its original height.</p>

<h3><i>Gas Mains, and Branch Pipes.</i></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="largecap">T</span>he name of <i>mains</i>, is given in the strictest sense
of the word, to the cast-iron pipes from two inches
in diameter and upwards, placed under ground,
for conveying the gas into smaller branch pipes;
but in a more extended sense, the term is applied
to every pipe from which smaller ramifications
or branch pipes proceed.</p>

<p>All mains destined to convey coal gas should be
proved, they should be submitted to the trial of
sustaining a column of water 300 feet high, and the
pipe should be rejected if the least moisture appears
on any part of the side of the pipe whilst submitted<span class="pagenum" id="Page240">[240]</span>
to this trial. For although such a pipe
may remain impervious to gas for some time, the
imperfection or fissure which permits the water
to issue through under such a pressure, speedily
increases, in consequence of the moisture to which
the main under ground must necessarily be exposed.
A skilful workman who is in the habit of
proving pipes will distinguish, with an astonishing
degree of correctness, a faulty pipe, by the sound
produced by blows of the hammer upon the pipe.
The faulty part, when struck upon, produces a
jarring sound very different from the clear sound
which a blow of the hammer produces when the
pipe is in a perfect state. By this means the workman
also detects, by the ear, inequalities in the
thickness of the metal of the pipe.</p>

<p>Fig. 14, <a href="#PlateV">plate V.</a>, represents a longitudinal section
of two flanch pipes, and the mode of connecting
them. <i>a</i>, and <i>b</i>, are the pipes with their flanches
connected; they are joined together, and rendered
air-tight, by first interposing between the flanches
a coat of iron cement, and then screwing up the
faces of the flanches by means of screw bolts and
nuts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page241">[241]</span></p>

<p>The composition of the cement is as follows:</p>

<p>Take four ounces of flour of sulphur, and two
of muriate of ammonia, and mix them intimately
together. When the cement is wanted, take five
ounces of the above mixture, and add to it six
pounds of cast iron borings, and blend them intimately
together in a mortar; wet the mixture with
water, and when brought to a proper consistence,
apply it to the joints with a wooden or blunt
iron spatula.</p>

<p>A degree of action takes place among the ingredients
and the iron surfaces to which it is applied,
which at last causes the whole to unite into one
mass. In fact, after a time, the mixture and the
surfaces of the flanches become a species of pyrites
(containing a very large proportion of iron) all the
parts of which cohere strongly together, and form
one mass. It is essential that no larger quantity of
the ingredients of the cement should be mixed
up with water, than is required for immediate
use.</p>

<p>Fig. 15, <a href="#PlateV">plate V.</a>, represents a longitudinal section
of a spigot and faucet pipe. These pipes
are most commonly used as gas mains. <i>a</i>, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page242">[242]</span>
called the spigot, <i>b</i>, the faucet. The cavity between
the inside of one, and the outside of the
other, is partly filled with rope yarn, or oakum,
and a good fitting of the two pipes being thus
effected, melted lead is poured into the cavity,
which when set, is hammered in by the end of a
punch.</p>

<p>The inner parts of the faucet of these pipes
ought to be no larger in diameter than just to fit
the spigot. This supports the pipe, independently
of the interposed lead and rope yarn, and prevents
the risk of hurting the joint from any external
stress. The inner faucet is commonly made about
two and a half inches deep, and has the spigot
inserted one and a half inch into it. The practice
of some manufacturers is to make the outer faucet,
or that which contains the lead six inches deep, for
all pipes above six inches in diameter; and to make
the faucets of all pipes below six inches, the same
depth as the diameter of the pipes. It is usual to
make the space for the oakum and lead all round
the spigot, from one inch to one and a quarter inch;
that width is required, in order that the lead may
be firmly driven into the joint. When the space<span class="pagenum" id="Page243">[243]</span>
is very narrow, this cannot be done. On the
other hand, when too wide, there is a waste of
lead, and a risk of injury from the unequal expansion
of the two metals.</p>

<p>All gas mains laid in public streets should be
placed at least eighteen inches below the surface
of the ground, to secure them from being disturbed
by carriages, or interfering with the paving of the
street; they should be placed perfectly firm, so
that they may not easily give way.</p>

<p>The course of all gas mains should be rectilinear,
with a dip of about one inch, in every ten feet
distance.</p>

<p>In all wide streets, where the number of houses
on both sides of the streets, to be supplied with
gas, is numerous, it is more economical to employ
a separate gas main for each side of the
street, than to make use of one larger main for
both sides; because smaller mains may then be
employed, and the collateral branch pipes leading
into the houses are shorter; these circumstances
amply compensate for the additional main. All
<i>branch</i> pipes proceeding from a main, should have
a dip of about one inch in ten feet, towards the<span class="pagenum" id="Page244">[244]</span>
main from which they proceed, so that any fluid
that may happen to collect in these pipes must run
into the mains.</p>

<p>All small wrought iron branch pipes proceeding
from the mains into the houses or places to be
lighted with gas, should be covered with a thick
coat of coal tar, before they are laid down into
the ground; this may easily be done by heating
the pipe, and laying on the boiled tar with a
brush.</p>

<p>Every separate length of branch pipe should be
tried by condensing the pipe under water, in order
to be certain that the pipe is sound. The junctures
of these pipes should be made by dipping
the male screw of the pipe into a mixture of white
lead and linseed oil, before they are screwed together.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the usual care which can be
taken in proving pipes, before the gas is admitted
into them, a slight leakage may be sometimes subsequently
detected.</p>

<p>Therefore, before the gas is suffered to enter
the mains, they should be again proved, in order
to be certain that all the junctures are air tight.<span class="pagenum" id="Page245">[245]</span>
The most convenient manner of proving the mains
when laid, is by means of a small portable gas
holder filled with common air, and connected by
means of a small pipe, with the system of the
mains to be tried. This gas holder should be
made to act with a pressure at least four times
greater than the pressure which the pipes will have
to sustain by the gas they are to convey. If the
mains are air tight, the gas holder will remain
stationary, but if they are not sound, the gas holder
will descend, in proportion to the leak of the
mains, the quantity of gas lost may be thus ascertained.</p>

<p>Every quarter of a mile of pipe should thus be
tried separately. In this manner we become also
enabled to detect instantly, whether any collateral
branch pipe has been left open by the workmen,
a neglect by no means uncommon in this department
of the gas light business.</p>

<p>In order to guard against the danger of water
entering from the external surface into the pipes,
a reservoir should always be placed at the lowest
point, where two or more descending mains meet
and form an angle, so as to receive the water<span class="pagenum" id="Page246">[246]</span>
that may happen to collect at this angular point,
an accumulation of which would cut off the communication
between the two pipes; this reservoir
is usually called a siphon, see <a href="#Page221">page 221</a>. It ought
to be at least twice the diameter of the bore of
the mains, between which it is interposed, and four
times that diameter in depth. These reservoirs
afford the best indication to show the sound or
leaky state of the system of the mains. In all instances
where the pipes are perfectly sound, observation
has shown, that half a mile of gas mains,
three inches in the bore, does not deposit more
than a quart of water in a year; on the other hand,
if the mains are leaky, the water of the reservoir
requires to be pumped out, sometimes as frequently
as every fortnight, and during wet weather, much
oftener. The loss of gas by such leakage is much
greater than is generally imagined. Instances
might be mentioned where, in order to keep the
common air out of a system of faulty pipes, a constant
influx of gas which a pipe two inches in
diameter can supply has been found necessary,
and this of course is just so much gas lost to the
economy of the establishment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page247">[247]</span></p>

<p>With regard to the diameter of the mains, no
general rule can be given. It must vary according
to the number of branch pipes and lamps which the
main has to supply within a given distance,&mdash;the
angular direction of the mains,&mdash;the pressure of the
gas holder, and above all, with the relative altitude
of the place where the gas holder is situated, and
the place at which the gas is to be supplied, or
where the lamps are placed. Indeed this is one
of the most important considerations with regard
to the economical distribution of gas mains, and
by attending to this circumstance, a prodigious
saving may be effected.</p>

<p>If the gas flows through a main placed at an
altitude of the gas holder, and with a pressure to
support a column of water half an inch high, this
gas at an altitude of 100 feet, will support a column
of water <sup>11</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub> inch high, and as the velocity of the gas
is as the <sup>2</sup>√ of the height, or pressure, the quantity
of gas which will flow through a given opening at
an elevation of 100 feet, will be very nearly in the
proportion of two to three. Hence if a gas burner,
or gas lamp, produces a flame two inches high, at
a place situated on a level with the base of the gas<span class="pagenum" id="Page248">[248]</span>
holder, the lamp, if supplied by the same main,
but situated 100 feet higher, will burn with a
flame three inches high.</p>

<p>This important fact may be rendered obvious
in the following simple manner:</p>

<p>Take a tube ten or fifteen feet long, and one
inch in diameter, place it horizontally; let one
end of the tube be open, and close the other with
a plate pierced with a hole, of about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>32</sub> of an
inch in diameter, and then fill the tube with gas.
If a lighted taper be applied to the hole, when the
tube is lying horizontally, the gas will not take
fire; but on raising the end of the tube where
the small aperture is, the gas will take fire, and the
magnitude of the flame will become enlarged in
proportion as the tube approaches towards the
perpendicular.</p>

<p>Hence the diameter of gas mains must be varied,
according to the altitude of the place to be supplied
with gas. And it is in consequence of neglecting
this principle that we observe so frequently certain
parts of large towns scantily supplied with gas,
whilst other parts furnished from the same mains,
situated considerably above the level of the gas<span class="pagenum" id="Page249">[249]</span>
holder, have the gas in the greatest profusion, but
at the expense of those places situated at a lower
level. And so true is this, that if a main were to
descend 100 feet below the base of the gas holder,
and if the pressure of the gas in the main was only
equal to sustain a column of water half an inch in
height, the gas lamps could not be lighted at all, at
a point so low, because the pressure of the gas is
then in an equilibrium with the pressure of the
atmosphere. Hence in lighting a town or district
with coal gas, the best situation for the gas apparatus,
as far at least as it regards the economy of the
mains for distributing the gas, is the lowest part of
the town or district. For if the mains are placed
at an elevated situation, they require to be proportionally
larger, and if situated at a lower place than
the level of the gas holder, they must be smaller;
but in either case the mains must bear a proper
proportion to each other, according to the conditions
and circumstances already stated, and it is
here, where the skill of the gas light engineer
becomes conspicuous, for the saving that may thus
be effected in the lighting of a district or town with
gas, is very considerable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page250">[250]</span></p>

<p>The requisite pressure of the gas for different
situations with regard to the altitude of the place
to be lighted, may be readily known by ascertaining
the altitude of the place by means of the
mountain barometer. The Englefield mountain
barometer is most commodious and suitable for
that purpose. This instrument is not liable to
be out of order, it may be used by a single
observer, and affords an easy method of ascertaining
the elevations and depressions of the surfaces
of the earth with the greatest facility, and
to a degree of precision, that may vie with
trigonometrical mensuration. Thus supposing
the pressure of the gas at the level of the gas
holder to be equal to a column of water half
an inch high, by inspecting the height of the
barometer, the requisite pressure of the gas at that
place may readily be found.</p>

<p>That part of a gas main which does not supply
any gas to a branch pipe or lamps, as it proceeds in
its course need only be a quarter of the capacity
which is necessary at the part where the branch
pipe or pipes commence. For no inconvenience
can arise from the increased velocity which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page251">[251]</span>
gas must assume in proportion to the diminution
of the bore of the main, provided that the velocity
of the gas is lessened by passing into a main of a
greater bore, prior to it being conveyed into the
pipe or pipes immediately connected with or supplying
the lamps. The enlargement of the pipes
should be in the proportion to the diameter of the
two pipes, as four to one.</p>

<h3><i>Weight of cast iron Gas Mains of different
lengths and bores.</i></h3>

<p>In order to avoid that the gas mains deposited
under ground in public streets or other places,
may not be on the one hand superfluously heavy,
or as it is called <i>thick in the metal</i>, and consequently
unnecessarily expensive, and on the other
hand not too light, or too thin in the metal, so
as to be liable to become injured, we shall exhibit
the weight of gas mains of different bores
and lengths best suited for conveying gas, now<span class="pagenum" id="Page252">[252]</span>
employed at the best regulated gas works in the
metropolis.<a id="FNanchor50"></a><a href="#Footnote50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote50"></a><a href="#FNanchor50"><span class="label">[50]</span></a>
A mile of pipe of an average diameter, laid under ground ready
for conveying gas, together with taking up and making good the
pavement, costs in London, about £. 1000.&mdash;And in small towns
where the lights are usually less clustered together than is the case in
London, and where pipes of three inches in the bore are usually
sufficient, a mile of pipe complete costs about £. 700.</p>

<h3><i>Gas Lamps, and Burners.</i></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="largecap">T</span>he lamps or burners for the combustion of
coal gas, may be infinitely and tastefully varied.
The varieties commonly employed, are the Argand
burner, the Cockspur burner, and the Bat’s Wing
burner.</p>

<p>The <i>Argand burner</i>, fig. 10, and 11, <a href="#PlateV">plate V.</a>,
consists of two concentric brass tubes, about one
and a half inch long, and seven-eighths of an inch
in diameter, (the largest size burner employed.)
The interval between the two tubes is closed at top
and bottom. The upper part is closed with a ring<span class="pagenum" id="Page254">[254]</span>
of steel, it is perforated with fifteen or eighteen
holes <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>30</sub> of an inch in diameter. The gas enters
into the cavity between the two tubes, and issues
from the circular row of apertures in the steel ring
at the top of the burner where it is burnt. A double
supply of air within and without the flame is effected
by means of the glass which surrounds the flame.
The combustion of the gas is perfect when the
admission of air is in due proportion to the magnitude
of the flame. The height of the gas flame
should never exceed three times the diameter of
the flame. When the flame is too large, the light
is less brilliant, and it then produces an odour,
because the combustion is imperfect.</p>

<p>The best shape of the glass for surrounding the
gas flame of the Argand lamp, is a straight tube,
shown fig. 8, <a href="#PlateV">plate V.</a>, or a tube enlarged at the
base, shown fig. 9, <a href="#PlateV">plate V.</a> Fig. 10, <a href="#PlateV">plate V.</a>,
is called a crutched argand gas burner, it is used
for pillar lamps; fig. 11, is called a branch argand
burner.</p>

<p>It is essential that the apertures for the emission
of the gas of the argand gas lamp, be perfectly
round and of an uniform size, without this condition<span class="pagenum" id="Page255">[255]</span>
the flame of the lamp is ragged, and not
well defined.</p>

<p>Fig. 15, <a href="#PlateIII">plate III.</a>, exhibits a swing bracket,
furnished with a <i>cockspur burner</i>. The burner
consists of a hollow flattened globe, about half
an inch in diameter, pierced laterally with three
or more holes, of about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>30</sub> of an inch in diameter;
out of these holes the gas flame issues in streams as
shown in the sketch. With this burner the combustion
of the gas is imperfect, and it is a wasteful
mode of burning coal gas. The surrounding holes
of the cockspur burner, was it not for the upward
current of air, would give flames radiating in
straight lines from the centre of the burner, but
the ascending current of heated air, causes them to
curve upwards like the spur of a game cock, and
hence the name cockspur burner.</p>

<p>If the gas be made to burn from a series of holes
made in the lateral circumference of a hollow flat
cylinder, it will produce a circular horizontal
series of flames curving upwards.</p>

<p>Fig. 12. <a href="#PlateV">plate V.</a>, is called a <i>bat’s wing</i> burner;
it consists of a small pear-shaped steel burner, about
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> of an inch in diameter, having a perpendicular<span class="pagenum" id="Page256">[256]</span>
slit at its upper extremity, about <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>40</sub> of an inch in
diameter. This burner exhibits a tulip-shaped
flame, as shown fig. 13, <a href="#PlateV">plate V.</a>, it is well adapted
for street gas lamps.</p>

<p>The stop-cock for admitting gas into gas burners
should always be placed at least six inches from
the burner. The stop-cock in the brackets, fig. 8,
or 9, <a href="#PlateV">plate V.</a>, is placed at <i>a</i>. <i>Pendant gas lamps</i>,
into which the gas is conveyed from a pipe above,
through the ceiling, should be provided with a
mercurial joint, or ball and socket joint. The
former contrivance is preferable, because it can
never leak;<a id="FNanchor51"></a><a href="#Footnote51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> but the latter requires occasional repairs.
Fig. 14, <a href="#PlateIII">plate III.</a>, shews the mercurial
joint. <i>a</i>, is the pipe which brings the gas; it terminates
in a sheet iron cup open at bottom, but
closed air tight at the top; this cup is inverted into
a small iron bason, containing mercury. D the
iron tube which communicates with the gas lamp
or burner, and the upper extremity of which projects
above the surface of the mercury in the iron<span class="pagenum" id="Page257">[257]</span>
bason, whilst the other extremity proceeds to the
burners or lamps.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote51"></a><a href="#FNanchor51"><span class="label">[51]</span></a> This contrivance has been adopted throughout the fitting up of
the gas lights at the Royal Mint.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p><i>Swing bracket burners</i>, fig. 13, <a href="#PlateIII">plate III.</a>,
should have the axis of motion at the joints A, A,
A, perforated at right angles to each other, so as
to admit the moveable joints at A, to be left open,
without obstructing the passage of the gas when
the bracket assumes different angular positions.
All swing brackets ought to have a double, and not
a single joint, because the latter soon wears oval in
the two opposite edges; this is prevented by the
double joint having an uniform bearing at top and
bottom, it therefore can never leak.</p>

<p>Fig. 11, <a href="#PlateVI">plate VI.</a>, exhibits the arrangement
usually adopted for a <i>pendant perpendicular
sliding lamp, or chandelier</i>, which requires to be
raised or depressed. This contrivance is convenient
for lighting theatres, or public buildings, by
means of a large central gas light chandelier, that
may be raised or depressed at pleasure.</p>

<p>The gas enters into the tube <i>D</i>, which is firmly
fixed in the ceiling, as shown in the sketch;
it passes through a hole near E, into a smaller
tube <i>j</i>, which slides perpendicularly within the<span class="pagenum" id="Page258">[258]</span>
tube D. This sliding tube is made air tight by
means of two stuffing boxes filled with oil, placed
near B, and C. The sliding tube <i>j</i>, together
with the chandelier suspended to it, is counter-balanced
by a weight concealed in a box W, connected
with pullies in the usual manner, as shown
in the sketch, so that the chandelier may be raised
or lowered at pleasure.</p>

<h3><i>Directions to Workmen, for adapting Gas
Pipes to the interior of houses.</i></h3>

<p>The adapting gas pipes to the interior of houses,
for the supply of gas, simple and easy as it may
appear, has been the means of not a little contributing
to bring the gas light illumination, on
many occasions, into disrepute. It has required
years to enable workmen of the best intention to
acquire sufficient practical skill in the proper
execution of a business, which must be pronounced
to constitute an art entirely new, and in
which no progress could be made, but after having
committed many errors. A house neatly and judiciously<span class="pagenum" id="Page259">[259]</span>
fitted up with gas pipes, displays to a
person experienced in this art, a skill and judgment,
equal to what is established in any other
branch of mechanical employment. It must be obvious,
that the art of arranging the pipes and adapting
them, is one of that class of operations in
which it is a real saving to employ the best materials
and skilful workmen, to avoid repairs and subsequent
alterations and derangements of the work.
The supply and distribution of the pipes, or the
<i>fitting up</i>, as it is called by the workmen, may be
done almost at any price with regard to workmanship
and materials, and to bargain for
cheapness in the execution of it, with a faithful,
honest, and skilful workman, must naturally be a
losing concern to the person for whom the work
is done. The cost of furnishing and adapting the
pipes to one place, cannot serve as a standard for
any other place, every separate place may present
difficulties which could not be foreseen at the
commencement of the work.</p>

<p>The stopping up and corrosion of the gas pipes,
which at the commencement of the introduction
of the new lights was complained of in many<span class="pagenum" id="Page260">[260]</span>
places, it is now sufficiently established, originated
entirely from the impurity of the gas, together
with a faulty arrangement of the pipes, in consequence
of which, the water of condensation
accumulating in certain parts, exercised a strong
chemical action on the copper pipes, and if the
gas was not very pure, ultimately corroded the
pipe. These objections do no longer exist, and it
may safely be pronounced, that pure coal gas produces
no action whatever on the copper tubes
through which it is conveyed. In proof of this
statement, we need only refer to the several districts
of the metropolis, fitted up with gas pipes
at the first introduction of the new lights, (1809,)
all of which are still in perfect preservation.</p>

<p>It is perhaps unnecessary to add, that no pipe
capable of being melted by a gas flame, should
ever be employed for conveying or distributing gas
through the interior of houses, because the facility
with which such pipes might be perforated, could
lead to serious consequences, if the gas issuing from
the aperture of the pipe were lighted, the flame in
that case would follow the melted part, through
the whole extent of the pipe, and the hazard by<span class="pagenum" id="Page261">[261]</span>
fire would be considerably increased. Therefore,
pewter, lead, and tin pipes, are very improper for
distributing gas through the interior of houses,
and should never be used for that purpose. Hence
copper, and iron pipes, are universally employed.</p>

<p>In order that the pipes for conveying the gas
from the mains, and distributing it through the
houses or other buildings to be lighted with gas,
may in the first place not be unnecessarily large,
or too small, the following rule may serve as a
guide to workmen:</p>

<p>One gas lamp,&mdash;consuming four cubic feet of
gas in an hour, if situated twenty feet distance from
the main which supplies the gas, requires a tube
not less than a quarter of an inch in the bore.</p>

<p>Two lamps,&mdash;30 feet distance from the main, require
a tube <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> of an inch in the bore.</p>

<p>Three lamps,&mdash;30 feet distance from the main,
require a tube <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> of an inch in the bore.</p>

<p>Four lamps,&mdash;40 feet distance from the main, require
a tube <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inch in the bore.</p>

<p>Six lamps,&mdash;50 feet distance from the main, require
a tube <sup>5</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> of an inch in the bore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page262">[262]</span></p>

<p>Ten lamps,&mdash;100 feet distance from the main,
require a tube <sup>3</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> of an inch in the bore.</p>

<p>Fifteen lamps,&mdash;130 feet distance from the main,
require a tube 1 inch in the bore.</p>

<p>Twenty lamps,&mdash;150 feet distance from the main,
require a tube 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inch in the bore.</p>

<p>Twenty-five lamps,&mdash;180 feet distance from the
main, require a tube 1<sup>5</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> of an inch in the bore.</p>

<p>Thirty lamps,&mdash;200 feet distance from the main,
require a tube 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inch in the bore.</p>

<p>Thirty-five lamps,&mdash;250 feet distance from the
main, require a tube 1<sup>5</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> of an inch in the bore.</p>

<p>All copper pipes employed to convey gas through
the interior of houses should be of the following
weight, with regard to a given length of the pipe:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page263">[263]</span></p>

<p>No coppered pipes should be used but such as
have wrapt over and brazed joints. They should
be well annealed, to render them pliable without
being liable to break.</p>

<p>All the bends for connecting pipes must be circular,
see fig. 22, <a href="#PlateV">plate V.</a></p>

<p>No branch pipe ought to proceed from a pipe of
a quarter of an inch in the bore, and no more than
two branch pipes should proceed from a pipe
three-eighths of an inch in the bore.</p>

<p>All branch pipes before they are fixed for conveying
gas, must be proved by condensing air
into them by means of a condensing hand pump.
The pipe should be placed in a trough of water,
the leak will then be easily observed by the air
bubbles which rise through the water whilst the air
is condensed in the pipes.</p>

<p>All branch pipes should have a rectilinear
course; pipes that are twisted have an unsightly
appearance.</p>

<p>All pipes should have a descent of no less than
a quarter of an inch in four feet.</p>

<p>The seams or brazed part of the pipes must
always be out most and not towards the wall;<span class="pagenum" id="Page264">[264]</span>
because if a leak should happen to take place in
the brazed part of the pipe, it may then be easily
discovered and more readily repaired.</p>

<p>When all the pipes have been furnished to a
house or place intended to be lighted, the whole
system of the pipes should be examined with the
utmost rigour, to ascertain whether all the junctures
are air tight. This should be done by condensing
air into the pipes by means of a condensing
syringe, and if the piston of the syringe lowers
after condensation, it is a sure indication that the
pipes are faulty, and consequently totally unfit for
receiving the gas. The leak may be detected by
passing a lighted taper carefully along the whole
extent of the pipe filled with condensed air, when
the flame of the taper will be affected as it passes
over the faulty place of the pipe.</p>

<p>The aperture from which the gas can escape
may however, be so small, as to render it a matter
of difficulty to discover it in the manner
just stated; but when the pipes are filled with
coal gas, the escape of it, when all the stop-cocks
of the lamps and burners are shut, will soon
become obvious, by the peculiar odour of the gas,<span class="pagenum" id="Page265">[265]</span>
if the apartment, or place, where the pipes are
placed, is suffered to be closed for about twenty-four
hours. The gas should not be introduced
into pipes in which any defect of this kind is
found, until it be completely removed. The most
severe trial to ascertain the air tightness of any system
of pipes is, the trial by exhaustion, by means
of an air pump, for the guage of the pump will
discover the minutest leak, which the preceding
method of proving pipes can not discover.</p>

<p>All pipes after being proved should be painted
of the same colour as the surface to which they
are affixed.</p>

<p>The whole system of pipes should incline to one
or more places, so that any moisture that may
happen to accumulate in the pipes, may collect
at such places, whence it may be readily removed
by opening a screw plug adapted for that purpose.</p>

<p>All the different junctures of mains and branch
pipes, should be effected by means of connecting
pieces, so that any part of the system of the pipes, or
any separate branch pipe may readily be detached,<span class="pagenum" id="Page266">[266]</span>
and put up again if occasion should require it;
fig. 19, <a href="#PlateV">plate V.</a>, exhibits this mode of connecting
gas pipes by means of union joints. A, B, C, D, E,
shows a gas pipe with its union or connecting
joint, divided into its separate parts. <i>D</i>, is a
collar of leather, which passes over the part C, of
the union joint, close up to the shoulder of the
joint; the opposite extremity of the pipe may be
inserted into the socket <i>B</i>, so that the shoulder C,
comes in contact with the fillet or rim in B, to prevent
it passing over the shoulder C, when B and E
are screwed together. The latter part of the pipe
is furnished with a male screw to correspond with
the thread in the collar B. The shoulder piece C,
is of rather a larger diameter than the bore of the
tube A, with which it is to be connected. The
short piece E, furnished with a male screw, is of the
same diameter as the part C. The pieces C, and E,
of the pipe are soft soldered, one to the tube A,
and the other to the tube E, but previous to
soldering on C, it is necessary that the socket
should be inserted into the tube A, it will then
be ready for connecting, as will become obvious by<span class="pagenum" id="Page267">[267]</span>
inspecting fig. 20, which shows the various parts
of the union joint fitted for use. It is evident that
if the extremity D, in the pipe B, be brought close
to the pipe E, and if the socket C, be moved along
the pipe A, and screwed upon the male screw at D,
as far as it will go, the face of the part D, must
press close against the leather collar which is
placed on E, and render the joint gas tight. These
kind of joints are very convenient for circular
bends, fig. 22, and T, pieces, fig. 21. The T
pieces, fig. 21, are very useful for collateral branch
pipes, either for the same or of a less diameter as
the pipe, from which they proceed, so as to branch
off at right angles.</p>

<p>Fig. 22, is a quarter circular bend; it is convenient
for adapting tubes along the angular parts
of rooms, and to all such situations where the
tube is to have a sudden circular course. Small
copper tubes may be readily bent to the required
angle without breaking, but if a tube should
terminate in any angular part of a room, in that
case a circular bend furnished with a male and
female screw, is convenient for connecting the
pipes together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page268">[268]</span></p>

<p>All pipes adapted to the exterior of buildings,
should be kept a little distance off from the wall,
to prevent the wet lodging between the pipe and
the surface to which they adapted.</p>

<p>Sheet iron mains for the interior of houses, are
preferable to copper mains, provided the course of
the main with regard to the position of the branch
pipes, does not require too many angular directions,
or circular bends.</p>

<h3><i>Illuminating power of Coal Gas, and quantity
of Gas consumed in a given time, by different
kinds of Burners, and Gas Lamps.</i></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="largecap">T</span>he illuminating power of coal gas, differs according
to the nature of the coal from which it is
obtained, and the manner in which it is purified,
together with the quantity of naptha or essential
oil chemically combined, or mechanically suspended
in the gas. For if the gas be strongly agitated
with water, its illuminating power is diminished.
Coal gas, which abounds in olifiant gas
or supercarburetted hydrogen possesses the greatest
illuminating power, and hence carburetted hydrogen
obtained from the decomposition of coal
tar possesses a greater illuminating power than the<span class="pagenum" id="Page270">[270]</span>
gas obtained from the coals which produced the
tar. The illuminating power of carburetted hydrogen
obtained from coal tar when compared to
the gas obtained from the best Newcastle coal is in
the proportion as six to five. In fact the intensity
of light evolved during the combustion of gazeous
bodies composed of carbon, hydrogen, and
oxigen, is always in the ratio of the quantity of
carbon contained in equal quantities of the gazeous
compound, and hence the gas from animal oil which
is chiefly composed of supercarburetted hydrogen
or olifiant gas, surpasses in illuminating power the
gas obtained from coal.</p>

<p>Half a cubic foot of coal gas, obtained in the
ordinary way of manufacturing coal gas, from Newcastle
coal, is equal in illuminating power and
duration of time, to the light produced by a tallow
candle six in the pound, burning for one hour,
and as such a tallow candle lasts five hours, therefore
fifteen cubic feet of coal gas, are equal in
value with regard to illuminating power to one
pound of candles. And as 112 pounds of Newcastle
coal produce by the new method of manufacturing
coal gas, at least 550 cubic feet of<span class="pagenum" id="Page271">[271]</span>
gas, therefore the quantity of gas produced from a
chaldron of Newcastle or Sunderland coal, (the
minimum weight of which is 27 cwt.) is equal
in illuminating power to 1000 pounds of tallow
candles.</p>

<p>The illuminating power of coal gas may readily
be ascertained. Though the eye is not fitted to
judge of the proportional power of different
lights, it can distinguish in many cases with sufficient
precision where two similar surfaces are
equally illuminated. As the lucid particles emitted
from luminous bodies are darted in right
lines, they must spread uniformly, and hence
their density diminishes in the duplicate ratio of
their distance. From the respective situations,
therefore, of the centres of divergency, when
the contrasted and illuminated surfaces become
equally bright, we are enabled to compute their
relative degrees of intensity. And for this purpose
it is assumed as a principle, that the same
quantity of light, diverging in all directions from
a luminous body, remains undiminished in all distances
from the centre of divergency.</p>

<p>Thus we must suppose, that the quantity of light<span class="pagenum" id="Page272">[272]</span>
falling on every object, is the same as would have
fallen on the places occupied by the shadow; and
if there were any doubt of the truth of the supposition,
it might be confirmed by some simple experiment.</p>

<p>Therefore, it follows, that, since the shadow of a
square inch of any surface occupies at twice the
distance of the surface from the luminous point the
space of four square inches, the intensity of the light
diminishes as the square of the distance increases.
If, consequently, we remove the two sources of light
to such distances from an object that they may illuminate
it in equal degrees, we are authorized to
conclude that their original intensities are inversely
as the squares of the distances.</p>

<p>Hence, if two lights of unequal illuminating
powers shine upon the same surface at equal obliquities,
and an opaque body be interposed between
them and the illuminated surface, the two shadows
produced must differ in blackness or intensity in
the same degree. For the shadow formed by intercepting
the greater light, will be illuminated by
the smaller light only; and reversely, the other
shadow will be illuminated by the greater light;<span class="pagenum" id="Page273">[273]</span>
that is to say, the stronger light will be attended
with the deeper shadow.</p>

<p>Now it is easy by removing the stronger light
to a greater distance, to make the shadow which it
produces equal to that afforded by the less light.
Experiments of this kind may be made in the following
manner:</p>

<p>Fasten a sheet of white paper against the wall
of a room, and place the two lights intended to be
compared, so that the rays of light from each fall
with nearly the same angle of incidence upon the
middle of the paper. In this situation, if a book
or other object be held to intercept part of the
light, which would have fallen on the paper, the
shadows may be made to appear as in this figure:</p>

<div class="containerc20m">

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illo273.png" alt="Sheets of paper" />
</div>

</div><!--container-->

<p class="noindent">where A represents the surface illuminated by
one of the lights only; B, the surface illuminated
by the other light; C, the perfect shadow from
which both lights are excluded. It will easily be
understood that the lights about D and E, near the
angle F, will fall with equal incidences when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page274">[274]</span>
double shadow is made to occupy the middle of the
paper; and consequently, if one or both of the
lights be removed directly towards or from the
paper, as the appearances may require, until the
two shadows at E and D have the same intensity,
the quantities of light emitted by each, will be as
the squares of the distances from the paper.</p>

<p>By experiments of this kind, many useful particulars
may be shewn; for, since the cost and duration
of candles, and the consumption of coal gas, or
oil in lamps, are easily ascertainable, it may be shewn
whether more or less light is obtained at the same
expense during a given time, by burning a number
of small lights, instead of one or more of greater
intensities. And thus we may compare the power
of different kinds of lamps or candles, with gas
lights of different intensities, so as to determine
the relative cost of each particular kind of the combustible
substance employed for furnishing light.
For example; if a candle and a gas burner supplying
coal gas, adjusted by a stop-cock, produce the same
darkness of shadow, at the same distance from the
wall, the strength or intensity of light is the same.</p>

<p>An uniform degree of intensity of the gas light<span class="pagenum" id="Page275">[275]</span>
may readily be produced, by opening or shutting
the stop-cock, if more or less light be required, and
the candle kept carefully snuffed to produce the
most regular and greatest quantity of light. The size
of the flame, in experiments of this kind, of course
becomes unnecessary, and will vary very much with
the quality or chemical constitution of the coal gas.
The bulk of the gas consumed, and the weight of
tallow or oil used by weighing the candle or oil
before and after the experiment furnish the data
for calculating the relative cost of tallow, or oil
and gas, when compared with each other.</p>

<p>The following statement exhibits the quantity of
coal gas consumed in a given time, by different
kinds of argand lamps. An argand burner which
measures in the upper rim half an inch in diameter,
between the holes from which the gas issues,
when furnished with five apertures <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>25</sub> part of an
inch in diameter, consumes two cubic feet of gas
in an hour, when the gas flame is one and a half
inch high. The illuminating power produced by
this burner is equal to three tallow candles eight in
the pound.</p>

<p>An argand burner three quarters of an inch in<span class="pagenum" id="Page276">[276]</span>
diameter between the holes in the upper rim, and
perforated with holes, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>30</sub> of an inch in diameter,
consumes three cubic feet of gas in an hour, when
the flame is two and a quarter inches high, and
produces a light equal in intensity to four tallow
candles, eight in a pound.</p>

<p>An argand burner seven-eighths of an inch in
diameter, perforated with eighteen holes <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>32</sub> of an
inch in diameter, consumes when the flame of the
gas is three inches high, four cubic feet of gas in
an hour, and produces a light equal in intensity to
six tallow candles, eight in the pound.</p>

<p>When the flame obtained by these kind of burners
rises to a greater height, than what has been
stated, the combustion of the gas is imperfect,
the intensity of the light becomes diminished, and
there is a waste of gas. The same holds good with
regard to the size of the holes from which the gas
issues; if the holes be made larger than <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>25</sub> part of
an inch in these kind of burners, the gas is not
completely burnt, and its illuminating power
decreases.</p>

<p>The height of the glass which surrounds the
flame, should never be less than five inches, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page277">[277]</span>
the interval for the current of air within and without
the flame, ought to bear the usual proportion
adopted for the combustion of oil in the common
argand lamps of similar diameters.</p>

<h3><i>Ventilation of Apartments lighted by Coal Gas.</i></h3>

<p>Before means had been devised for the effectual
purification of coal gas, a disagreeable odour was
found to attend its combustion in an impure state,
and hence an opinion became prevalent, that the
benefit of this new species of illumination must be
confined to open places, and that it could not with
any regard to pleasure or salubrity, be adapted to
private dwellings.</p>

<p>The art of purifying coal gas, has at length however,
been carried to such a perfection, that every
possibility of a disagreeable odour arising from its
combustion has been wholly removed, in all cases
where attention is paid to the perfect combustion
of the gas, by keeping the flame of the same of a
proper magnitude.</p>

<p>And since this improvement, the use of coal gas,<span class="pagenum" id="Page278">[278]</span>
as a means of illumination has become as general,
and has been found attended with as superior advantages
within doors as without, and hence a vast
number of dwelling houses are now lighted throughout
with gas.</p>

<p>Although there is no occasion therefore, to make
provision for ventilating apartments where gas light
is employed, on account of any odour which it can
produce when honestly used, so that the combustion
is perfect, yet on other accounts such means
of ventilations are very salutary and necessary.</p>

<p>The flame of coal gas produces a degree of heat,<a id="FNanchor52"></a><a href="#Footnote52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
which in some places, such as large public offices,
and warehouses of dry goods, is a strong additional
recommendation in favour of its use, (<a href="#Page15">page 15</a>,)
while in others, on the contrary, such as small
rooms numerously frequented, and shops containing
commodities requiring to be kept cool, it can
only be used beneficially when means are provided
for conveying away the heated air.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote52"></a><a href="#FNanchor52"><span class="label">[52]</span></a>
Mr. Dalton’s method of ascertaining the comparative effect of
heat evolved during the combustion of inflammable gases, and other
substances capable of burning with flame, (Dalton’s System of Chemistry,
vol. I. p. 76,) is simple, easy, and accurate. It is as follows:</p>

<p>Take a bladder of any size, (let us suppose for the sake of illustration,
the bladder to hold 30,000 grains of water,) and having furnished
it with a stop-cock and small jet pipe, fill it with the combustible gas
the heating power of which is to be tried. Take also a tinned iron
vessel with a concave bottom of the same capacity, pour into it as
much water as will make the vessel and water together equal to the
bulk of the water in the bladder, viz. 30,000 grains. Then set fire
to the gas at the orifice of the pipe, bring the point of the flame
under the bottom of the tinned vessel, and suffer it to burn there, by
squeezing the bladder till the whole of the gas is consumed. The
increase of temperature of the water in the tinned vessel before and
after the experiment, expresses very accurately the heating power of
the given bulk of the inflammable gas. It was thus proved that&mdash;</p>

<p>The best method for this purpose is to make an
aperture of about two or three inches in diameter
into the chimney near the ceiling, and inserting
into it a tube bending upwards into the interior
of the chimney. A complete ventilation of the
room will thus be established, by producing an
extra vent which will be amply sufficient for carrying<span class="pagenum" id="Page280">[280]</span>
off the heated air. The aperture can easily
be masked with some ornamental open work, corresponding
with the style of the room.</p>

<p>If there happens to be no chimney in the apartment,
the ventilator may be made in the ceiling, and
the tube may be carried between the ceiling and the
floor above, into the open air. The mode of ventilation
now suggested, has been uniformly found most
efficient, and has, under existing circumstances, a
decided superiority over another method, which
we see in some instances adopted. This method
consists in enclosing the gas burner in a bell-shaped
glass, from the upper part of which a large
copper tube proceeds, and leads out into the open
air. It is certain that by this means not only the
heated air is carried off, and the possibility of any
waste gas escaping into the apartment is also completely
prevented. But at the same time, by taking
away all occasion for a prudent limitation in the
use of the gas, it exposes it to a degree of improvident
waste, in the hands of dishonest and careless
individuals, which must prove ruinous to the
manufacturer. The mode of regulating the light
of the flames by means of the governor, of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page281">[281]</span>
a description has been given, <a href="#Page232">page 232</a>, indeed
provides a check against such waste, and there
can be no doubt that in proportion as this instrument
gets into general use, the objection on this
score must of course fall to the ground; but under
any circumstances the inelegance of the contrivance
of such an object in a chamber, as the large
branching tube, must always induce a preference,
for the more simple, and for all necessary purposes,
equally efficient method, of the ventilator before
described.</p>

<h3><i>Gas from Coal Tar.</i></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="largecap">A</span>lthough the tar which forms one of the products
obtained from the decomposition of pit coal,
in the manufacture of coal gas, has become an
article of commerce, being found applicable to
most of those purposes to which vegetable tar has
hitherto been used, it appears from experiments
made on a large scale, that instead of thus disposing
of the coal tar, it is more profitable, under
certain circumstances, to submit this substance to
a destructive distillation, for the purpose of obtaining
from it carburetted hydrogen gas, which it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page283">[283]</span>
capable of affording, not only in abundance, but of
a superior quality.</p>

<p>The chief circumstances which must determine
the manufacturer of coal gas in this respect, is the
price at which he can sell the coke produced in his
establishment. If the price of this article is high,
if he finds a ready market for coke, there is every
reason to believe, that the manufacturer will find
it more to his advantage to dispose of the tar, and
to manufacture gas from coal alone, in order to
increase his store of coke. But if coke happens to
be at a low price, and not disposable with advantage,
the manufacturer will do well to make the
coal go as far as possible in the production of gas,
and under such circumstances he will keep and
convert the tar into gas, thus consuming less coal
and having less of the burdensome article, coke,
to dispose of.</p>

<p>The profit however, to be gained from the sale
of coke, must be both certain and considerable, to
induce a preference for the former course; because
the decomposition of coal tar, besides superseding
a proportionate quantity of coal, is attended with
several other very tempting advantages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page284">[284]</span></p>

<p>From experiments lately made in the metropolis
on this subject, in which I have been engaged,
it appears that in all large gas light establishments,
where the quantity of coal tar rapidly
accumulates, and must be got rid of, and in all places
where the tar cannot be sold for more than four
shillings the hundred weight, it will be certainly
advantageous to the manufacturer to decompose
the tar for the production of carburetted hydrogen
gas.</p>

<p>The price of coal cannot effect the operation,
because where coal bears a high price, the manufacturer
of the tar gas, will diminish the quantity of
coal which he would otherwise be called upon to
employ for the production of the requisite quantity
of gas. And in places where coal is cheap, the
decomposition of the tar will be attended with
less expence.</p>

<p>The carburetted hydrogen gas produced from
coal tar, possesses a greater illuminating power
than the gas obtained from coal.<a id="FNanchor53"></a><a href="#Footnote53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> It consists
chiefly of supercarburetted hydrogen or olifiant<span class="pagenum" id="Page285">[285]</span>
gas, and a less quantity of it is of course sufficient.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote53"></a><a href="#FNanchor53"><span class="label">[53]</span></a>
Vegetable tar, also affords carburetted hydrogen gas in abundance,
and this no doubt might be employed to great advantage for the
production of artificial light in places where it is cheap. 212 pounds
of the most viscid Swedish tar, produce 1484 cubic feet of carburetted
hydrogen, (or seven cubic feet to one pound of tar,) the illuminating
power of this gas is equal to the gas obtained from pit coal.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The gas thus obtained, is purified likewise with
far greater facility, taking only one hundred and
twentieth part of the quantity of quicklime which
is required for the purification of carburetted
hydrogen obtained from pit coal. The apparatus
for the production of carburetted hydrogen from
coal tar, is moreover less bulky, less expensive,
and less complicated; and it can be managed by
fewer workmen. And as the combined result of
these several advantages, it is obvious, that by the
substitution of coal tar, the new mode of lighting
by gas can be pursued on a smaller scale; which
it can never be with any profit, where coal itself is
immediately employed for the production of the
gas.</p>

<p>The apparatus employed by Mr. Clegg, for the
distillation of tar, is extremely simple. It consists
of two hollow cast iron cylinders, twelve inches<span class="pagenum" id="Page286">[286]</span>
in diameter, and nine feet long, furnished with
moveable lids or mouth pieces, and joined together
at the extremity opposite to the mouth piece.
These cylinders are fixed in a brick furnace, so
that each inclines eleven degrees, one above and
the other below the horizontal base of the furnace.</p>

<p>When the apparatus has acquired a dull red
heat, the coal tar is suffered to flow into the upper
cylinder, by small portions at a time.</p>

<p>The tar is contained in a closed vessel, situated
at any convenient place above the apparatus.
It has a small aperture for the admission of air.
But as a sufficient small quantity of viscid tar
does not flow freely in a thin stream, a larger
portion than is wanted, is made to flow first into a
a small box, upon the apex of a pyramid which
divides the stream, so that the excess runs off by
a waste pipe, whilst a due quantity only is conveyed
into the retort where it is decomposed.</p>

<p>This apparatus<a id="FNanchor54"></a><a href="#Footnote54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> therefore differs only from the
apparatus described in the Journal of Science and
the Arts, 1816, No. II., p. 282; that the cylinders<span class="pagenum" id="Page287">[287]</span>
may be detached, for cleaning them out more conveniently.</p>

<h3><i>Gas from Oil.</i></h3>

<p>“Messrs. J. and P. Taylor<a id="FNanchor57"></a><a href="#Footnote57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> are the first persons
who have resorted to oil as a substance from which
gas for illumination could be easily and cheaply
prepared; and in the construction of a convenient
apparatus for the decomposition of this body, they
have fully shewn its numerous advantages over
coal, while they have afforded the means of producing
the most pure and brilliant flame from the
inferior and cheap oils, which could not be used in
lamps. The apparatus for the purpose is much
smaller, much simpler, and yet equally effectual,
with the best coal gas apparatus. The retort is a
bent cast iron tube, which is heated red by a small
convenient furnace, and into which oil is allowed
to drop by a very ingenious apparatus; the oil is
immediately volatilized, and the vapour in traversing
the tube becomes perfectly decomposed.
A mixture of inflammable gases, which contains a
great proportion of olifiant gas passes off; it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page290">[290]</span>
washed by being passed through a vessel of water
(which dissolves a little sebacic acid, and which
seldom requires changing), and is then conducted
into the gasometer.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote57"></a><a href="#FNanchor57"><span class="label">[57]</span></a> Copied from the Journal of Science and the Arts, Vol. VI. p. 108.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>“The facility and cleanliness with which gas is
prepared from oil in the above manner, may be
conceived from the description of the process. A
small furnace is lighted, and a sufficient quantity
of the commonest oil is put into a small iron vessel,
a cock is turned, and the gas after passing through
water in the washing vessel, goes into the gasometer.
The operation may be stopped by shutting
off the oil, or, to a certain extent, hastened by
letting it on more freely; the small quantity of
charcoal deposited in the retort is drawn out by a
small rake, and the water of the washer is very
rarely changed.”</p>

<p>“The gas prepared from oil is very superior in
quality to that from coal; it cannot possibly contain
sulphuretted hydrogen, or any extraneous substance;
it gives a much brighter and denser flame;
and it is also more effectual, i. e. a lesser quantity
will supply the burner with fuel. These peculiarities
are occasioned, in the first place, by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page291">[291]</span>
absence of sulphur from oil, and then by the gas
containing more carbon in solution. As the proportion
of light given out by the flame of a gaseous
compound of carbon and hydrogen, is in common
circumstances in proportion to the quantity of
carbon present; it is evident that the gas which
contains a greater proportion of olifiant gas, or
supercarburetted hydrogen than coal gas, will yield
a better and brighter light on combustion.”</p>

<p>“It is necessary, in consequence of the abundance
of charcoal in solution, to supply the gas when
burning with plenty of atmospheric air, for as there
is more combustible matter in a certain volume of
it, than in an equal volume of coal gas, it of necessity
must have more oxigen for its consumption.<a id="FNanchor58"></a><a href="#Footnote58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
The consequence is, that less gas must be burnt in
a flame of equal size, which will still possess superior<span class="pagenum" id="Page292">[292]</span>
brilliancy; that less is necessary for the same
purpose of illumination; and that less heat will be
occasioned. From five and a half to six cubical
feet of coal gas are required to supply an Argand
burner for an hour; two cubical feet to two and a
half of that from oil, are abundantly sufficient for
the same purpose.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote58"></a><a href="#FNanchor58"><span class="label">[58]</span></a> Dr. W. Henry’s experiments gave the following result:&mdash;100
cubic inches of carburetted hydrogen from coal, require, for burning,
220 cubic inches of oxigen, and produce 100 cubic inches of carbonic
acid&mdash;100 cubic inches of carburetted hydrogen gas procured from
lamp oil, require 190 cubic inches of oxigen, and produce 124 cubic
inches of carbonic acid,&mdash;100 cubic inches of carburetted hydrogen
obtained from wax, require 280 cubic inches of oxigen, and produce
137 cubic inches of carbonic acid.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>“One important advantage gained by the circumstance,
that so small a quantity of this gas is
necessary for burners is, that the gasometer required
may be small in proportion. The gasometer
is the most bulky part of a gas apparatus,
and that least capable of concentration; and where-ever
it is placed, it occupies room to the exclusion
of every thing else. Some very ingenious attempts
have been made to diminish its size and
weight, as in the double gasometer,<a id="FNanchor59"></a><a href="#Footnote59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> and others,
but without remarkable success. Here, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page293">[293]</span>
where the room required to contain the gas is
directly diminished, the object is so far obtained;
and when that takes place to one half, or even
one third, it is of very great importance. It in
a great number of cases brings the size of the
apparatus within what can be allowed in private
houses; and in consequence of the rapidity with
which the retort can be worked, the gasometer may
again be reduced to a still smaller size.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote59"></a><a href="#FNanchor59"><span class="label">[59]</span></a> This contrivance is more expensive and complicated than any of
the gas holders of which a description has been given; nor is it safe,
for if the slightest leak should happen in the interior vessel of the
double gas holder, an explosive mixture would be formed, and
dreadful consequences might follow; this can never be the case with
any of the machines now in use.&mdash;<i>Note of the Author.</i></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>“Another advantage gained by the small quantity
of gas required for a flame, is the proportionate
diminution of heat arising from the lights. The
quantities of heat and light produced by the combustion
of inflammable gases are by no means in
the same constant relation to each other; one frequently
increases, whilst the other diminishes; and
this is eminently the case when coal gas and oil gas
are burned against each other. The quantity of
heat liberated is, speaking generally, as the quantity
of gas consumed, and this is greatest with the
coal gas; but the quantity of light is nearly as the
quantity of carbon that is well burnt in the flame,
and this is greatest in the oil gas.”</p>

<p>“The very compact state in which the apparatus<span class="pagenum" id="Page294">[294]</span>
necessary for the decomposition of oil can be placed,
the slight degree of attention required, its certainty
of action, its cleanliness, and the numerous applications
which it admits of in the use of its furnace
for other convenient or economical purposes, render
it not only unobjectionable, but useful in
manufactories and establishments; and these favourable
circumstances are accompanied, not from any
inferiority in the flame or increased expense, but
by an improved state of the first, and saving in the
latter.”</p>

<p>“Messrs. Taylor have shewn great ingenuity in
the construction of their whole apparatus, but the
washer and gasometer deserve particular notice for
their remarkable simplicity also. In the washer,
two planes are fixed in a box or cistern, in a direction
not quite horizontal, but inclined a little in
opposite directions; the planes are traversed nearly
across by slips of wood or metal, fixed in an inclined
position on the under surface, and which
alternately touch one side of the cistern, leaving
the other open and free. These planes being immersed
in water, the gas is thrown in under the
lowest ridge, and by its ascending power is made<span class="pagenum" id="Page295">[295]</span>
to traverse backward and forward along the ridges
fixed on the planes, until it escapes at the highest
part of the uppermost ridge. Thus, with a pressure
of five or six inches of water only, it is made
to pass through a distance of fourteen or sixteen
feet under the surface of the fluid, and becomes well
washed.”</p>

<p>“The smaller gasometers are made of thin plate
iron, and being placed in a frame of light iron
work, look more like ornamental stoves than the
bulky appendages to a gas apparatus, which they
supply. The larger ones are made very light, and
when in pieces very portable, by being constructed
of a frame of wood work, in the edges of which are
deep narrow grooves; plates of iron fit into these
grooves, which being caulked in and painted over,
make a light and tight apparatus. These are
easily put together in any place, and may therefore
be introduced into a small apartment, or other
confined space, where a gasometer already made
up would not enter.”</p>

<p>For the following additional information on this
subject, I am indebted to Messrs. J. and P. Taylor.</p>

<p>“The economy of obtaining gas for the production<span class="pagenum" id="Page296">[296]</span>
of light from oil, may be judged of from the
following data.”</p>

<p>“One gallon of common whale oil, produces
about ninety cubic feet of gas.<a id="FNanchor60"></a><a href="#Footnote60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> An argand burner
required a cubic foot and a half of gas per
hour; and consequently a gallon of oil when converted
into gas, will supply the same burner for
sixty hours. The expence of the gas at a moderate
price of oil, will be, allowing for coals, labour,
&amp;c. for producing the gas, three farthings per
hour, and such a burner will give a light, equal
in intensity, to two argand lamps, or ten mould
candles.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote60"></a><a href="#FNanchor60"><span class="label">[60]</span></a> Our experiments produced 105 cubic feet, from one gallon of
common whale oil.&mdash;<i>Note of the Author.</i></p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>“The expence of an argand oil lamp, is usually
admitted to be, about three halfpence per hour.
Now supposing ten candles to be burning, four
to the pound (two pound and a half,) they will cost
2<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i> of which one-tenth part will be consumed
in each hour. The cost of the tallow light is then
three pence halfpenny per hour.”</p>

<p>“If wax candles be employed, the expence of the
light equal to an oil gas burner for one hour, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page297">[297]</span>
the same mode of reckoning, allowing the candle
to burn ten hours, and taking the price of the
wax candles, at 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per pound, will be
about 14<i>d.</i>”</p>

<p>“The comparative account will therefore stand
thus:</p>

<table class="compacc" summary="Comparative account">

<tr>
<th>&nbsp;</th>
<th>PENCE.</th>

<p>“These calculations on the cost of light from
oil gas, are taken at the usual price of good whale
oil, but cheaper oils will answer the purpose
nearly as well, and as many of these are often to
be procured, the whole expence becomes materially
reduced by their use.”</p>

Tar&mdash;Pitch&mdash;Coal Oil&mdash;Ammoniacal
Liquor, and conversion of the latter into
Carbonate, and Muriate of Ammonia.</i></h3>

<h4><i>Coal Tar.</i></h4>

<p class="noindent"><span class="largecap">T</span>he coal tar is so called from its resembling common
tar in its appearance, and most of its qualities.</p>

<p>This substance is deposited in the purification
of the coal gas, in a separate vessel destined to
receive it. See fig. 3, <a href="#PlateI">plate I.</a></p>

<p>In the year 1665, Becher, a German chemist,
brought to England his discovery for extracting tar<span class="pagenum" id="Page299">[299]</span>
from coal, this distillation he performed in close
vessels. It is not mentioned in the records of the
time, whether Becher obtained, or rather collected,
any other articles than the tar.</p>

<p>Several works have been, at different times,
erected both in England and on the continent, to
procure from coal a substitute for tar; but they
have turned out unprofitable speculations.</p>

<p>In 1781, the Earl of Dundonald invented a
mode of distilling coal in the large way, which
enabled him not only to form the coke, but, at
the same time, to save and collect the tar. Even
this process, however, for which a patent was
taken out, gained very little ground. Its object
was too limited; for though some of the proximate
constituent parts of coal were procured, they
were obtained at an expence that nearly balanced
the profits; and no attention whatever was paid to
the coal gas, which constitutes by far the most valuable
part obtainable from pit coal.</p>

<p>Coal tar is now used with advantage largely in
the Royal Navy, and also for painting and securing
wood that is exposed to the action of air. The
wood being warmed, the tar is applied cold, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page300">[300]</span>
penetrating into the pores, gives the timber an uncommon
degree of hardness and durability.</p>

<p>The quantity of tar obtainable from a given
quantity of coal, varies according to the manner
in which the decomposition of the coal is affected.
See <a href="#Page122">page 122</a>.</p>

<p>The tar obtained from Newcastle coal is specifically
heavier than that produced from cannel coal;
hence it sinks in water, whereas the latter swims
on the surface of that fluid.</p>

<p>To render coal tar fit for use, it requires to be
evaporated to give it a sufficient consistence. If
this process be performed in close vessels, a portion
of an essential oil is obtained, which is known by
the name of</p>

<h4><i>Coal Oil.</i></h4>

<p>To obtain this oil, a common still is charged
with coal tar, and, being properly luted, the fire is
kindled and kept up very moderate, for the tar is
very apt to boil up in the early part of the process.
The first product that distils over is principally a<span class="pagenum" id="Page301">[301]</span>
brown ammoniacal fluid, mixed with a good deal
of oil. As the process advances, and the heat is increased,
the quantity of ammoniacal liquor lessens,
and that of oil increases, and towards the end of the
distillation the product is chiefly oil.</p>

<p>The oil and ammoniacal water which distil over
do not mix, so that they may be easily separated by
decantation. The oil is a yellowish inferior kind
of naptha, which is very useful in painting ships,
and for making common varnishes. It has lately
been employed as a substitute for whale oil, to be
burnt in out door lamps.</p>

<p>The contrivance by means of which this oil is
burnt in lamps<a id="FNanchor61"></a><a href="#Footnote61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> consists of a fountain reservoir to
supply and preserve a constant level. The burner
with its wick is placed in the axis of the lamp, and
supplied with the oil from the fountain reservoir,
placed on the outside of the lamp. The air is admitted
by an aperture at the bottom of the lamp.
The current of air in passing through the lamp envelopes
the burner and urges the flame, which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page302">[302]</span>
extremely bright; but it is essential that the flame
should be small. The draught tube proceeding
from the centre of the reflector above the flame
carries away the smoke.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote61"></a><a href="#FNanchor61"><span class="label">[61]</span></a> All the lamps on Waterloo Bridge, and the streets adjoining the
bridge are lighted by means of tar oil.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>1430 pounds of coal tar, produce 360 pounds of
essential oil. The residue left after the distillation
is</p>

<h4><i>Pitch.</i></h4>

<p>If the coal tar is wanted to be converted into
pitch, without obtaining the oil which it is capable
of furnishing, the evaporation of it may be performed
in a common boiler; but as it is extremely
liable to boil over, the greatest precaution is necessary
in conducting the evaporation. A spout or
rim is added to the common boiler into which the
tar spreads itself as it rises, and by this means
becomes cooled, and the boiling over is checked.</p>

<p>1430 pounds of coal tar produce 9 cwt. of pitch.
A subsequent evaporation with a gentle heat,
converts the coal pitch into a substance greatly resembling
<i>asphaltum</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page303">[303]</span></p>

<h4><i>Manufacture of Carbonate of Ammonia from
the Ammoniacal Liquor of Pit Coal.</i></h4>

<p>The ammoniacal liquor obtained in the gas light
manufacture, is employed for the production of
carbonate of ammonia. The average quantity of
this liquor, obtainable from a chaldron, (27 cwt.)
of Newcastle, or Sunderland coal, amounts to
from 180 to 220 pounds. It is chiefly composed
of carbonate and sulphate of ammonia. The quantity
of ammonia contained in it, varies considerably.
The strongest liquor is obtained from coal that
readily cake, (<a href="#Page45">page 45</a>); a gallon (or eight and a
half pounds weight) of ammoniacal liquor usually
requires for saturation, from fifteen to sixteen
ounces of sulphuric acid of a specific gravity 1,84.
The weakest ammoniacal liquor is obtained from
those species of coal which do not cake, and which
by a single combustion are reduced to light ashes.
It requires only from eight to ten ounces of sulphuric
acid, of the before mentioned specific
gravity for its saturation.</p>

<p>The following process is employed in the large<span class="pagenum" id="Page304">[304]</span>
way, for obtaining carbonate of ammonia from the
ammoniacal liquor. To 108 gallons<a id="FNanchor62"></a><a href="#Footnote62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> of the liquor
contained in a cask, are added 125 pounds<a id="FNanchor63"></a><a href="#Footnote63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> of
finely ground sulphate of lime, which has been
previously deprived of moisture by heat. The cask
is bunged up, and the mixture after being stirred
together for a few minutes, is left undisturbed for
three or four hours. Sixteen ounces of sulphuric
acid are then added, the mixture is again agitated,
and is again suffered to stand undisturbed for four
or six hours. If the liquor be now examined, it
will turn blue litmus paper, red.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote62"></a><a href="#FNanchor62"><span class="label">[62]</span></a> One gallon of the strongest ammoniacal liquor, weighs eight and
a half pounds.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote63"></a><a href="#FNanchor63"><span class="label">[63]</span></a> This quantity is evidently too large, but the workmen assert, that
an excess of sulphate of lime causes the carbonate of lime which is
formed, to subside more readily, and the excess of sulphate of lime
can do no injury.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>In this operation a double decomposition takes
place, the sulphate of lime yields part of its sulphuric
acid, to the carbonate of ammonia of the
liquor, to form sulphate of ammonia, and the
carbonic acid of the ammonia, combines with the
lime of the sulphate of lime, to form carbonate of
lime, which falls to the bottom, the supernatant
fluid contains in solution, sulphate of ammonia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page305">[305]</span></p>

<p>When the liquor has become clear, it is pumped
out of the barrel into shallow cast iron boilers,
where it is evaporated slowly. During this process,
a portion of sulphate of lime is deposited
which is removed, and as the liquor becomes more
concentrated, part of the sulphate of ammonia
begins to crystallize and falls to the bottom. It
is shovelled out from time to time into wicker
baskets, placed slanting over the rim of the boiler,
that the liquor which drains off from the crystals
may not be lost, and lastly the whole fluid is evaporated
to dryness.</p>

<p>108 gallons of ammoniacal liquor from Newcastle
coal, produce upon an average, one and a half cwt.
of dry sulphate of ammonia. To decompose it,
one cwt. is mixt with one quarter of a cwt. of finely
ground chalk, previously deprived of moisture by
heat. The mixture is introduced (as expeditiously
as possible) into cast iron retorts,<a id="FNanchor64"></a><a href="#Footnote64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> heated nearly
to a dull redness, and when the lid of the retorts
have been rendered air tight, the fire is raised gradually
till the retorts are of a strong red heat.<span class="pagenum" id="Page306">[306]</span>
The carbonate of ammonia developed from the
contents of the retorts, is made to sublime into a
leaden barrel-shaped receiver, connected with the
retorts, by means of a pipe four inches in diameter,
proceeding from the upper extremity of each retort,
and opposite to the mouth piece. The leaden receiver
is furnished with a leaden cover, fitting into
a groove, where it is made air tight by lute. The
receiver which is supported upon a stand is provided
at its base, with a small pipe, furnished with
a stopper. This pipe is left open till the liquid
products are got rid of during the sublimatory process.
In the centre of the cover, or at any other
convenient part of the apparatus, is made a small
hole, slightly stopped with a wooden peg, to give
vent to the elastic fluid that becomes evolved during
the process.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote64"></a><a href="#FNanchor64"><span class="label">[64]</span></a> Of the usual form and dimensions, described <a href="#Page58">page 58</a>.</p>

</div><!--footnote-->

<p>The time requisite for the operation depends on
the mode in which the retorts are set, the temperature
kept up and other practical circumstances. A
charge of 120 pounds of the mixture of sulphate
of ammonia and chalk in one retort, is usually
decomposed in twenty-four hours. When the
operation is at an end, and the receiver having<span class="pagenum" id="Page307">[307]</span>
become cold, the cover is taken off, and the sublimed
carbonate of ammonia adhering to the sides of the
receiver is detached by a chissel and mallet, and
after being freed from any casual impurities, is
packed up in stone jars for sale.</p>

<p>One cwt. of dry sulphate of ammonia, produces
from sixty pounds, to sixty-five pounds, of pure carbonate
of ammonia. In some establishments, the
carbonate of ammonia is subjected to a second sublimation
by means of a gentle heat; but this is
quite unnecessary if the process has been conducted
carefully.</p>

<h4><i>Manufacture of Muriate of Ammonia from the
Ammoniacal Liquor of Coal.</i></h4>

<p>It must be obvious that the ammoniacal liquor
may be employed with great advantage for the
production of muriate of ammonia. For if the solution
of sulphate of ammonia obtained from the
ammoniacal liquor by means of sulphate of lime,
as before stated, be mixed with common salt, (or
any other muriate) another decomposition takes<span class="pagenum" id="Page308">[308]</span>
place. The muriatic acid of the common salt,
unites to the ammonia of the sulphate of ammonia,
and produces muriate of ammonia, and the sulphuric
acid of the sulphate of ammonia, combines
with the soda of the common salt, and produces
sulphate of soda, or glauber salt.</p>

<p>The liquor containing these two salts being
evaporated, the glauber salt begins to crystallize,
and is removed from time to time. The evaporation
is continued till as much as possible of the
glauber salt has been separated, and the muriate
of ammonia begins to crystallize on the surface of
the fluid in the form of a feathered star. The
remaining fluid is then run off into coolers, and
deposits little else than muriate of ammonia, till
it gets below the temperature of 76° Fahr. at
which time the crystals are to be removed, lest
they should be mixed with glauber’s salt which
now begins to be again deposited. After the muriate
of ammonia has been suffered to drain in
baskets, it is heated in shallow pans to drive off as
much water of crystallization as possible. It is
then removed whilst still hot, into earthenware
jars, glazed within, and fitted with a cover, (having<span class="pagenum" id="Page309">[309]</span>
a hole of about half an inch in diameter in its
centre,) luted on with clay. The jars are put
in a cast iron pot over a strong fire, in a furnace
capable of containing from six to eighteen jars,
surrounded with sand up to the edge of the pot,
and also having about two and a half inches of
sand on the cover, confined by an iron ring about
three inches deep, and two inches less in diameter
than the cover, in order that if the luting should
give way in any part, it may be repaired without
suffering the covers (which should be kept during
the sublimation at about 320° Fahr.) to be cooled
by the removal of a large portion of the sand.</p>

<p>These earthen jars may be filled to within two
inches of the top, with the dried salt gently pressed
in, but not rammed close; and the fire which has
been lighted some time before, is now to be raised
gradually till the iron pots are of a pretty strong
red heat all round, being so placed by mean of
flues in the furnace that the upper part may be
first heated, the bottom resting on solid brick
work.</p>

<p>During the first impression of the heat, a portion
of the salt carrying with it a quantity of<span class="pagenum" id="Page310">[310]</span>
watery vapour not separated during the drying of
the salt, will escape through the hole in the cover,
which must be left open till all the aqueous part is
exhaled: this is known by bringing a piece of
cold smooth iron plate near the hole, in order to
condense the sublimate, which becoming more and
more dry, at length attaches itself firmly to the
plate, in the form of a dry semi-transparent crust.</p>

<p>At this time the hole is to be stopped with lute,
more sand is to be put on the cover, and the heat
continued till it is judged that nearly the whole of
the muriate of ammonia is sublimed. The time
requisite for this purpose depends on the construction
of the furnace, the size of the pots, the briskness
of the fire, and other circumstances only
to be learnt by experience.</p>

<p>The process should be stopped before the sublimation
has entirely ceased, as the heat in some parts
of the jar may be too great when it is nearly empty,
and either by volatilizing a part of the salt itself, or
elevating a portion of foreign matter from which it
can never be kept wholly free, and thus giving
the cake a yellow tinge, and a scorched, opake,
crackled appearance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page311">[311]</span></p>

<p>The same defects are likely to happen, when any
part of the luting having given way, is obliged to
be repaired by wet lute, when the sublimation is
pretty far advanced: consequently glass vessels are
preferable, except on account of the expence, as
they must always be broken to pieces in order to
get out the cake: the earthenware jars on the contrary
will serve for several sublimations, even the
covers, if well glazed, will last two operations. The
sublimation being finished and the apparatus having
become sufficiently cool, the tops of the jars are to
be taken off, and the cakes of sal-ammoniac that
are found adhering to them are to be separated,
and placed for a day or two in a damp atmosphere,
which softens their surface a little, and thus facilitates
the removal of any superficial impurities.
Lastly, the cakes are packed up in casks for
sale.</p>

<p>The excise laws have hitherto operated strongly
against the establishment of manufactories of muriate
of ammonia in England. Hence an immense
quantity of sulphate of ammonia obtained from the
gas light ammoniacal liquor, is exported from this
country to the continent, solely from the extreme<span class="pagenum" id="Page312">[312]</span>
rigour of the excise relating to the use of common
salt, and it is only this that has hitherto prevented
the establishment of manufactories of sal-ammoniac
from the ammoniacal liquor of the gas
light process upon a large scale.</p>

<p>Chemical manufactories, of all others, will least
bear excise, because many of them are worked
according to secret processes, which, if made
public, must pass into other countries; and the
greatest part of the profit ceases together with the
export. The vexatious introduction of excise
officers into manufacturing laboratories, it is evident,
puts an end to all secrecy of operation. There
are several chemical processes which interruption
will extremely injure, and others which it totally
destroys, and as on the whole they in general are
of a nature in which interference of others is most
peculiarly vexatious, in all probability, if the excise
be extended to manufactures of this nature, it will
eventually put a stop to most of them, and greatly
injure the revenue by causing thereby to cease the
duties which at present arise from the exports and
imports to a large amount, now depending on the
chemical trade of Great Britain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page313">[313]</span></p>

<p>We have now gone through all the improvements
by which the gas light manufacture has been
distinguished during the interval which has elapsed
since the publication of our former work<a id="FNanchor65"></a><a href="#Footnote65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> on this
subject; and perhaps the reader may be inclined
to think, from the extraordinary height to which
improvement has been carried in this art, that
little or nothing more remains to be desired with
regard to it. Let it be remembered, however,
that the whole art is only in its infancy. There
is yet a wide field for improvement in the construction
of the apparatus. Ingenious men may
speculate from what has been done, to what remains
to be effected, which no doubt will lead to
objects of the greatest utility, and most extended
national importance.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
